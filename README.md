## _That's What Who Said_
## Description

### Our motivation was to determine `who said what`

We wre interested in learninng about: 
- Spoken dialogue in multi-season TV shows with well-developed characters
- How characters' speaking styles aligned or differed 

While searching for a dataset of dialogue for one show (HBO's Succession), we found: 
- Transcription from closed captioning: 
    easy to obtain 
- Transciption with speaker labeled: 
    not as easy to obtain
