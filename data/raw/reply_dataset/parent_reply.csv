99,I can’t leave until you do.,"Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so… I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so… Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?",Michael

101,We both know that I’m here because of the comments you made.,"Here’s the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of… racial awareness and it’s probably more advanced than you’re used to. That’s probably throwing you off a little bit.",Michael
102,"Um, it’s not throwing me. I need your signature.","OK, well I know. You told me that several times.",Michael
103,"Yes, but you’re not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.",OK.,Michael
104,Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn’t be embarrassed.,"Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don’t.",Michael

No. Look… the guy, “Mr. Brown,” he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don’t. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn’t see any heart.

111,It was kind of hard to hear.,"Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um…",Michael
112,I have a customer meeting.,"Yeah, well, if you leave we’ll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste.

113,What part Native American?,Two fifteenths.,Michael
114,"Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn’t make any sense.","Well, you know what, it’s kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let’s get this popping. Come on. Who’s going? Who’s going? Let’s go here. Oscar, right here. You’re on.",Michael
115,"OK, Michael, um… Both my parents were born in Mexico.","Oh, yeah…",Michael

118,Thank… Yeah…,"Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?",Michael
119,Mexican isn’t offensive.,"Well, it has certain connotations.",Michael
120,Like what?,Like… I don’t… I don’t know.,Michael
121,"What connotations, Michael? You meant something.","No. Now, remember that honesty…",Michael
122,I’m just curious.,"…empathy, respect… Jim! Jim!",Michael

130,Maybe some spagh-etti.,"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn’t it? If I’d brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",Michael
131,It’s collard greens.,What?,Michael
132,It’s collard greens.,"That doesn’t really make sense. Because you don’t call them collared people, that’s offensive. Hmmm… OK, well, it’s after five. So… Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.",Michael
133,Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.,Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.,Michael
134,Does this company have 100 years to erase?,"No, the country.",Michael
135,"Oh right, more like 200 years.","Yeah, more like a 1,000.",Michael
136,"HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.","I just think that HERO? It’s cute, but it’s… It’s empty, you know? It’s easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind…",Michael
137,"Oh, nice.",Expectations….,Michael
138,Good.,Thank you. Sharing…,Michael
139,Great.,And tolerance.,Michael
140,"Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.","Well, it’s not ideal but you have to give me some credit ’cause I made it into a word.",Michael
141,"Yeah, but it’s not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.","I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We’re all a family, right? We’re all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally…",Michael
142,"Okay, Michael, I just…","No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.",Michael
143,"Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about…","Okay. I’m sorry, I’m sorry this guy’s a temp and I should’ve told you that.",Michael
144,"No, no, no, no. An outsider’s perspective would probably be pretty helpful.","Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he’s not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?",Michael
145,What do you want me to do?,"Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? ‘Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.",Michael

147,"Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.","Hi. I’m Michael Scott.

160,The Gold Plan? I’m not even on that plan.,"Well, I’d recommend it. It’s very good.",Michael
161,Michael.,You gotta crack these things open.,Michael

596,What award would you like to give Dwight?,I hadn’t planned on including him.,Michael
597,Okay.,Kevin.,Michael
598,"No, we were just hoping you wouldn’t do those characters, like last time.",Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He’s my most popular character.,Michael
599,I think many people find that character slightly racist.,"Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.",Michael
600,"Look, I’m just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.","Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what… Why do you care?",Michael
601,Dwight was in the ladies’ room and he was looking at me.,What?,Michael
602,That’s totally unfair. I was just in the ladies’ room in order to spy.,"Dwight, you’ve hit a new low here.",Michael
603,"What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, “Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.” I’m not even attracted to you.",That is a good point.,Michael
604,Write him up or I’ll take it to Jan.,"Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.",Michael
605,When?,"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you’re in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good.",Michael
606,"Yeah, you know me.",You down with the Dundies?,Michael
607,The Dundies!,You down with the Dundies? You’re all my homies,Michael
608,You know me.,You down with the Dundies?,Michael
609,"Yeah, you know me.","Yeah, all the homies",Michael
610,I’m just saying I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.,"He’s hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it?",Michael
611,"Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.","It was unanimous, Toby.",Michael
612,It wasn’t a vote. You decided.,"Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn’t even about what Ryan thinks. It’s about you. It’s about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.",Michael
613,"Okay, that is not true.","Yes, it is true.",Michael
614,‘Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.,"Okay, I don’t have time for this. I need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration. Me Chief Michael Scott. Here to trade…",Michael
615,You and your party really need to leave right now.,Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili’s?,Michael
616,You know what? Don’t worry about it.,Keep it. My gift. Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year.,Michael
617,Hey.,Any emails today?,Michael
618,Um… I don’t think so.,No? Um… Check your spam folder.,Michael
619,Oh! There it is!,What?,Michael
620,Um… ‘Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.’,...,Michael
621,Well done.,Kay.,Michael
622,So the monkey does the sex thing right here!,That’s funny! That’s funny. Not offensive. Uh… because it’s nature. Educational.,Michael
623,Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?,"Um, I…",Michael
624,Consider it?,"Yeah… maybe. Maybe. Well, we’ll see. Because I… I don’t know if it’s… Whup! Come on! Hey!",Michael
625,What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? This guy!,"Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!",Michael
626,...,"Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.",Michael
627,"bleep, bleep. What’s up, Halpert?",Uh oh.,Michael
628,Still queer?,Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!,Michael
629,"Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don’t know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here’s the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.",Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It’s going to be a bumpy one!,Michael
630,We’re talking blonde incompetent.,"Oh, yeah.",Michael
631,Like 10 words a minute… talking.,"Well, to be fair… blondes, brunettes, you know, there’s a lot of dumb people out there.",Michael
632,"They are women, right?",Oh! Wow! I didn’t say it! I didn’t say it!,Michael
633,"I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.","Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.",Michael
634,"Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?",Oh. Bad boy. Um… Ryan?,Michael
635,"Come on, kid. Let’s go.",Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.,Michael
636,Yes!,Forward it like it’s hot. Forward it like it’s hot. “Old School”.,Michael
637,Michael?,"Yes, Toby?",Michael
638,Um… I need to talk to you in your office. It’ll just take two seconds.,Um… literally two seconds?,Michael
639,The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.,"No, no, Toby. No.",Michael
640,"It’s really not a big deal, Michael.","It is a big deal. It’s a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!",Michael
641,And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer…,What?,Michael
642,Just to refresh you… .,NO!,Michael
643,on our policy.,"What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?",Michael
644,Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.,There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That’s why it’s a joke.,Michael
645,"Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I’ll go over that later.","I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can’t wait to see how you handle it.",Michael
646,Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?,"Um, yeah, no, well… I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.",Michael
647,Oh!,"Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know… a joke but not necessarily at my expense.",Michael
648,"Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the… good thing you don’t have a lot of business to start with.","Oooh, okay. That was still about me.",Michael
649,"Hey, hey, hey.",What?,Michael
650,So you don’t have the biggest package. Don’t feel bad.,I don’t feel bad.,Michael
651,I think he feels bad.,"No, I don’t.",Michael
652,You look like you feel bad.,Okay.,Michael
653,Little package!,"Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.",Michael
654,Little package! Little package!,Thank you.,Michael
655,"Um… in fact, basic rule of thumb, let’s just act everyday like Pam’s Mom’s coming in. All right. That’s it. Um… if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.","Hi, is it over?",Michael
656,"Uh, yes!",No.,Michael
657,I can go over it with you.,"I know, I know. It’s good. It is not over. It is not over til it’s over.",Michael
658,It’s over.,"Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn’t because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we’re losing? Seriously?",Michael
659,Email forwards.,Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?,Michael
660,I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you’ll have bad luck.,"Give me a break. Umm… Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl’s outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?",Michael
661,"All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?","I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.",Michael
662,"Yeah, Meredith.",No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?,Michael
663,Yes.,She would have definitely slept with me.,Michael
664,She wasn’t that hot.,"Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!",Michael
665,No.,What if they made out? In front of everybody?,Michael
666,"Well, that would be…",At home? And I told everybody everything about it.,Michael
667,"Okay, I’m lost.","Okay. Well, then let’s act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be… Okay! We’ll use the doll. Pam. Pam?",Michael
668,...,"I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um… we have to watch, uh, Toby’s video that he’s showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?",Michael
669,"No, thanks. I’m good.",That’s what she said. Pam?,Michael
670,Uh… my mother’s coming.,"That’s what she sai Nope, but… Okay. Well, suit yourself.",Michael
671,Yes! Right here. You are a naughty girl!,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa… Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.",Michael
672,"Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. Hi.","Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we’re watching that Corporate gave us… Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.",Michael
673,I love lawyer jokes.,"Well, it’s probably because you don’t get ’em.",Michael
674,"You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What’s the problem?",The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can’t say anything.,Michael
675,"Well, that… that’s true in a way. You can’t say anything.","Where’s the line? Where’s the line, Jan.",Michael
676,"Do you need to see the video again, Michael?","No, I’ve seen the video.",Michael
677,He talked the whole time.,"No, I didn’t. Huh, what?",Michael
678,Does that include ‘That’s What She Said’?,Mmmhmm. Yes.,Michael
679,"Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so…",THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID!,Michael
680,Michael. MICHAEL!,Come on.,Michael
681,There he is.,Mwah!,Michael
682,Mike… Michael. Please. I… I… really.,It’s… That’s…,Michael
683,That’s not my sense of humor.,"Okay. Hello. Jan. Mr. O’Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.",Michael
684,Wha…,I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.,Michael
685,"And motorcycle head injuries, worker’s comp, and diet pill lawsuits.",This guy does it all.,Michael
686,"‘Scuse me, I’m sorry. Michael. Mr. O’Malley is your lawyer.",What?,Michael
687,"Mr. O’Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.",So I’m not in trouble?,Michael
688,"Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.",I know. We’ll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.,Michael
689,Phyllis?,"No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.",Michael
690,Ex-squeeze me?,"Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.",Michael
691,Packer said it.,"No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.",Michael
692,"I’m the same age as you, Michael.",I don’t know about that.,Michael
693,We’re in the same High School class.,"Well, I have a late birthday and usually September’s a cut-off point. You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There’s a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.",Michael
694,You mean where my desk is?,"Yes, your corner. Go.",Michael
695,Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.,Mmmhmmm.,Michael
696,"Oh my. They really got to you, didn’t they?","They didn’t get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. C’mere, c’mere, c’mon! Come on! Come on.",Michael
697,Michael! Come on!,Oooh!,Michael
698,You don’t have to worry. I’m not going to…,I’m not worried.,Michael
699,…report you to HR.,"You know what? The only thing I’m worried about… is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.",Michael
700,"Good morning, Michael.",What’s going on?,Michael
701,Nothing. You look nice today.,What?,Michael
702,You look real thin.,I don’t get what you mean.,Michael
703,You just… You look good. Your shirt looks… You look real good.,"Well, you said I looked thin, so what does… Does that mean I’m like thin weird or thin handsome or…",Michael
704,"Thin handsome, Michael.","Yes, well, of course. Of course.",Michael
705,We’re not dating.,"No, but I’m saying hypothetically if we were dating…",Michael
706,"We’re not dating, I’m engaged.","Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.",Michael
707,I would say no.,"You say yes, and we go out.",Michael
708,I would drown myself.,"And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.",Michael
709,"I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.","Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.",Michael
710,"What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?","Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don’t you take a couple hours. The office is yours. “Home Alone,” “Risky Business.” Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.",Michael
711,I’m just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.,Ok. Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.,Michael
712,Diversifying. Smart.,"Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they’d throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.",Michael
713,"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People’d obey the law, there’d be less troublemakers.",Maybe.,Michael
714,You should go.,Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.,Michael
715,Uh huh.,Sign the papers at the condo.,Michael
716,You have your lawyer there?,"Uh, I don’t need one.",Michael
717,Can I be your representative?,I don’t need a representative.,Michael
718,I think I should be there.,"No, No.",Michael
719,I’m good. I can make sure things are up to code.,No. Dwight. I’m fine.,Michael
720,"Please, I’m always the guy you rely on at work.","Well, this isn’t about work. This is closing on a condo, it’s completely personal.",Michael
721,So you’re taking a personal day?,"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.",Michael
722,"Please, I’ll make you proud.","Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.",Michael
723,Yes! As your representative?,As my associate.,Michael
724,Same thing.,No it is not.,Michael
725,You headed out?,We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don’t you have everybody work on their expense reports and I’d like them in by the end of the day.,Michael
726,Ok.,Very good.,Michael
727,Have a great time.,"We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?",Michael
728,"Yeah, I changed them to your new address.",Good. The Small Business Man?,Michael
729,Yup.,Maxim? American Way? Cracked?,Michael
730,"Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.","How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?",Michael
731,...,"NO, well can you get on that, because I don’t just read Cracked. Thank you.",Michael
732,Yeah.,Ok. See you soon.,Michael
733,What kind of shocks you got on this baby?,"I don’t know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?",Michael
734,I want to put the top down.,"What? No, Dwight. It’s fifty degrees outside. Don’t… please…",Michael
735,But then no one can see us.,I… Just… Would you put it up? Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.,Michael
736,Check it out. Terminator.,I do not understand what you spend your money on.,Michael
737,Which one’s yours?,"Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back… wait… no, it’s this one, right here. Home, sweet home.",Michael
738,"Michael, this is Bill. He’s the head of the condo association.","Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He’d always get rolled over by something.",Michael
739,Nice to meet you.,Nice to meet you too.,Michael
740,This is smaller than your old place.,"Yeah, small. I’m buying it and I’m not renting it. So, it’s still an upgrade. He doesn’t know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.",Michael
741,It’s a very gay-friendly neighborhood.,Oh. Good. That’s good. It’s good to be accommodating of that.,Michael
742,Oh. Terrible idea.,I’m putting my bed right over here.,Michael
743,"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.","Well, then I will get a warrantee.",Michael
744,"Warrantees don’t cover it, plus they’re a rip-off.",Well then I won’t get a warrantee.,Michael
745,Shh Shh.,"So that’s the problem, is solved. What?",Michael
746,What kind of mortgage did you get?,Uh… Ten year.,Michael
747,"Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.",What? Wha? You said ten.,Michael
748,"Ho, thirty years.","Ok, ok, ok.",Michael
749,"Wow, you’ll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.",Alright.,Michael
750,"Forget about retiring when you’re 65. Hey, I’ve got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that’s where the nurse can live.",Ok. Alright. Oh boy.,Michael
751,Whenever you’re ready.,"Um. Oh. Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?",Michael
752,"Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.",Um. I’m going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.,Michael
753,We’ll be here waiting for you.,"Oh, man.",Michael
754,"Whenever you’re ready, Michael.",Uh.,Michael
755,What?,…know if you showed me this same unit or not.,Michael
756,"Michael, this is the unit you saw and…",Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.,Michael
757,Who told you that?,"As far as I can tell, I’m the best-looking person here.",Michael
758,"Is this a financial thing? If it’s a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.","No, no, no.",Michael
759,That’s some extra income for you.,I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.,Michael
760,"You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.",Ehhhh….,Michael
761,You didn’t have to…,"No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you’ve really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.",Michael
762,I don’t even know what to say.,"I’m thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we’ll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you’re, you know, you’re gone.",Michael
763,Question. Where can I put my terrarium?,What the hell is a terrarium?,Michael
764,It’s a fish tank for snakes and lizards.,"Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.",Michael
765,"Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?",We take separate cars.,Michael
766,Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?,Why would we do that?,Michael
767,Just for fun?,No.,Michael
768,Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?,"EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I’m sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I’m … Ok.",Michael
769,You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.,"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.",Michael
770,People love beets.,Nobody likes beets.,Michael
771,Everybody loves beets.,"Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don’t you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I’d love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.",Michael
772,Let’s get this roof going.,Stop it!,Michael
773,Michael.,Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What’s going… What’s going on?,Michael

798,"Uh, I don’t know. It’s pretty quiet.",Oh… That’s gonna change.,Michael
799,Why?,Because I loves to party and I’m gonna be partying my butt out at this place.,Michael

835,"Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn’t need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.","Okay, Dwight.",Michael
836,Self taught. You didn’t even go to college.,"You know what, Dwight? You don’t need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know… Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then… then you’d know what you’re talking about.",Michael
837,"Come on. I’m studying with the master, huh?","For instance, why don’t you go to business…",Michael
838,I am.,"Stop. Dwight. You know what? You’re acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He’s not your five year old brother, Dwight. He’s a valued member of this company… and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.",Michael
839,It’s a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.,You are so smart. You are so eff-in’ smart. You should be teaching me.,Michael
840,Maybe we should get some air.,"Nah, I’m okay.",Michael
841,"Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.","Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?",Michael
842,Okay. It’s called Who Would You Do?,"Oh, I play this at home all the time while I’m falling asleep. What, uh… . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?",Michael
843,"Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you.","Aaaall right. Who’s next, who’s next, who’s next, who’s? Jim? You’re next. Who would you do?",Michael
844,"Um… Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He’s really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.","Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. ‘Cause he is going to own his own business.",Michael
845,You’re all gay.,"Who’s, uh… Who’s next? Who we got? Whooo…",Michael
846,"Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk… this is great timing.","Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So…",Michael
847,Would that make you happy?,What’s that?,Michael
848,"If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?",Yeah.,Michael
849,I’m on it.,Dwight. Hey!,Michael
850,You can’t go in yet!,"Dwight, don’t! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.",Michael
851,What if he dies in the fire? And that’s the last thing you ever said to him.,I didn’t say it to him. I said it about him.,Michael
852,"Ooh, Toby!",How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don’t know either.,Michael
853,"Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We’re just here, we’re playing Desert Island. It’s when you pick your five favorite DVDs…","Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It’ll make it easier for him to find.",Michael
854,What’s your number?,I gave it to you in the car.,Michael
855,Um…,I saw you program it in.,Michael
856,You got to… you got to give it to me again.,Okay. Alright.,Michael
857,Now I have it.,"Uh, I better tell somebody. Excuse me, sir…",Michael
858,...,"Dwight!? Great goin’. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What… Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.",Michael
859,"Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don’t teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.","Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don’t teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.",Michael
860,That’s exactly what I said.,"Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?",Michael
861,Were you absent?,Toaster Oven 101?,Michael
862,Everybody!,…since the world was turning.,Michael
863,"Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.","Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.",Michael
864,That is so cool.,Mmm-hmm.,Michael
865,"Plus you can go, “Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.”","No, I’m not trying to trick him. I’m trying to be a good mentor. So…",Michael
866,Kill or be killed.,No.,Michael
867,"Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.","No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.",Michael
868,You could ask for an extension.,I’m not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.,Michael
869,Hey… Happy Halloween. Jan called.,Ohh… OK.,Michael
870,Jan Levinson’s office.,"Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.",Michael
871,"Oh, she’s in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go.","Well, I’m gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it’s best to wait till the end of the day.",Michael
872,I just need the name of who you’re planning to let go.,I don’t know… yet. I will have to call her back.,Michael
873,I know she wanted the name.,Okay… Sherri?,Michael
874,Yeah?,"If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?",Michael
875,"Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael.",Thanks.,Michael
876,Mm-Hmm.,I’ll call her back. Wish I could fire Sherri.,Michael
877,"Hey, I’m still here.",Okay! I’m sorry.,Michael
878,Yeah.,No?,Michael
879,OK.,Bye.,Michael
880,You wanted me?,Yes.,Michael
881,Papier-mache?,Yes.,Michael
882,Hmm.,Yeeesh.,Michael
883,Mm-hmm.,"Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.",Michael
884,Why did you put it off until Halloween?,Because it’s very scary stuff.,Michael
885,I think it’s gonna put a damper on the party a little.,You’re worried about the party? There’s a man’s life at stake here.,Michael
886,So it’s a man?,"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance… and who you think deserved to be fired – who would that be?",Michael
887,I just answer the phone.,And… sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.,Michael
888,You’re costume is fantastic!,I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.,Michael
889,"Oh no, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t. Aah! Okay…","Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.",Michael
890,Michael.,You guys excited about the party?,Michael
891,Yeah.,It’s gonna be fun.,Michael
892,Yes.,"Oh, boy… look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.",Michael
893,What are you implying?,All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?,Michael
894,"You know, I don’t know. We put them all up last night.","Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I’ll approve the overages. Sound good?",Michael
895,Yeah.,"Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I’m going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I’m going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",Michael
896,But we don’t keep two sets of books.,"Well, that’s not what I’m saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.",Michael
897,Why is that?,“Bend It Like Beckham.”,Michael
898,"Oh, like … the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?",Yeah. That would be perfect.,Michael
899,"Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don’t really play soccer or anything.","Well, I don’t really have two heads. So…",Michael
900,Jim. Definitely.,"No, Jim brings in money.",Michael
901,Phyllis.,Eh.,Michael
902,One of the warehouse guys.,What? There was someone left off that list? Who?,Michael
903,Who is he saying?,"You’re right, I didn’t even think of him.",Michael
904,"No, Michael.","Yeah, that’s actually a really good idea.",Michael
905,"No, not me.",Yeah… I could.,Michael
906,Not Dwight.,I’m not saying that’s what he said.,Michael
907,I know that’s what he said.,What?,Michael
908,"Tell him, not Dwight.",That is not a very nice thing to say about him.,Michael
909,Tell him to stop.,Are you kidding?,Michael
910,"Quiet, you.",I agree. He’d land on his feet.,Michael
911,He wouldn’t listen to me,"Ahh, come on.",Michael
912,"If you want to fire him, you’re going to have to tell him yourself.","I don’t wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I’m certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just…",Michael
913,"This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?","Oh, God.",Michael
914,"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.",Fantastic!,Michael
915,And I turned it down.,What?! That would’ve solved all my problems.,Michael
916,Out of loyalty to this company…,"Oh, you idiot.",Michael
917,… so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.,"If you left, I wouldn’t have to fire anybody.",Michael
918,But then you wouldn’t have me here.,"Big deal. Oh, it would’ve worked out so well. Can you get it back?",Michael
919,It’s in Maryland.,You can call. Can you call ’em?,Michael
920,I can’t. I… I suppose I coul… no. They never really made me an offer anyway.,Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.,Michael
921,"Honestly, I don’t think Michael has the slightest clue of who he’s gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone’s going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what’s going to happen is it’s gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",Can I speak to you a minute?,Michael
922,"Michael, I really didn’t mean to…",Help. Me.,Michael
923,I’m sorry?,"I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.",Michael
924,"Oh, you want me to be you?",Yes.,Michael
925,Okay.,"I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.",Michael
926,"Oh, are you firing Creed?","No, no, no. That’s just the first thing… came… in head.",Michael
927,We should switch seats in order to…,"Yes, that’s a good idea.",Michael
928,"Alright. Excuse me. I’m really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it’s purely budgetary. It’s not personal…",Aaaahh! I’m gonna kill myself!,Michael
929,Wow.,"I’m going to kill myself, and it’s your fault!",Michael
930,That’s an overreaction.,Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they’re saying this has to be done by the end of the month.,Michael
931,"Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you…",I… this is Creed.,Michael
932,Okay.,"I’m improvising, so just try to keep up.",Michael
933,"Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.","And I’m very angry, and I want…",Michael
934,Michael Scott here.,I’m gonna kill you. I’m going to kill you for firing me.,Michael
935,"Toby? Mm hmm. I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth…","Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just… yeah.",Michael
936,Huh?,Could I talk to you for a second?,Michael
937,What are you telling me?,I… we’re gonna have to… You… you want something better.,Michael
938,"No, I don’t. I wanna stay right here.","No, you wanna leave.",Michael
939,"No, I wanna stay here.",Why… why are you making this so hard?,Michael
940,"Um, I think there’s a misunderstanding, Michael.",I think you’re right.,Michael
941,Can I go?,"No, of course you can’t go. We haven’t even started this horrible process of… okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you’re a great guy, and I like you, you’re… you’re, goodbye.",Michael
942,Let’s fight it.,Hmm?,Michael
943,Let’s call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.,What old days? What are you talking about?,Michael
944,Did you start the paperwork yet?,"It’s right here on the desk, yeah.",Michael
945,"You don’t have to do this, Michael.","I can’t, I can’t…",Michael
946,Undo it!,I can’t change anything. This is the way…,Michael
947,"No, you have the power to undo it.","I don’t… okay, just listen.",Michael
948,"Michael, undo it!",Don’t…,Michael
949,Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He’s terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.,"Okay, well… I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you’re always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.",Michael
950,"No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You’re they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you’d see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You’re a fine man.",Don’t…,Michael
951,"Creed’s an idiot, you know that.","Well, he…",Michael
952,"No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time.","Well, maybe I did.",Michael
953,"Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man.","Huh. No! I can’t, no. I can’t go back. I would look like an idiot.",Michael
954,That’s why I’m being fired?,No.,Michael
955,So you might not look like an idiot?,"No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and…",Michael
956,This is unbelievable!,I just hope that you and I can remain friends.,Michael
957,What!,"Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili’s. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.",Michael
958,Trick or treat!,"He… Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.",Michael
959,I’m a bumble bee.,You look great! And you’re a princess?,Michael
960,A fairy princess.,A fairy princess. You’re very… .,Michael
961,I’m a lion.,"You’re a lion. Wow, I want to hear your, your… Oh! Oh, okay, that’s all yours. That’s all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.",Michael
962,Mmm-hmm.,Of course. You’re always working hard.,Michael
963,Thanks.,"Keep it up. And there’s Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.",Michael
964,"Something wrong, Michael?","No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything’s great. Just keep living your lives. Everything’s gonna be fine. You are all such wonderful, innocent people.",Michael
965,Michael?,What? What?,Michael
966,"Michael, do you have the name of the employee you’re letting go? I’d like to start working on out-placement.","Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it’s you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can’t say that I’m sorry. It’s a relief.",Michael
967,"I don’t report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.","You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you’re not doing your job. Why don’t you just resign?",Michael
968,They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.,"Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have.",Michael
969,"Hey, you wanna see a really messy show? Follow us around. Come to our office.",You know what? That’s my foot.,Michael
970,"Ass, ass, ass…",You guys…,Michael
971,Who is it?,"I don’t know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?",Michael
972,Building.,"Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.",Michael
973,"Yeah, We’re not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.","Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative.",Michael
974,"Michael, it’s almost 5:00.","Leave me alone, okay?",Michael
975,"No, no. I had some, thanks.","Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?",Michael
976,"Fifteen years, I think.","Yeah, that’s right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.",Michael
977,"Oh, no. I need the money.",Why?,Michael
978,"What do you mean, “Why?”",It’s just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.,Michael
979,I don’t know. I got nephews.,Yeah.,Michael
980,"Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?",Just trying to be your friend.,Michael
981,"Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.","Of course, I did. I always… Yes, I do.",Michael
982,Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?,Are you pulling my leg or…,Michael
983,No.,You have no clue why I’ve asked you in here?,Michael
984,I do not.,"Oh, here we go. This… um, here’s the deal.",Michael
985,This is Jan.,His name was Devon.,Michael
986,Excuse me?,The human being man’s name was Devon.,Michael
987,"Devon. The… Oh, is this the man that you…","Yes, yes, yes.",Michael
988,"The person that you fired, Michael?","Yes, it is.",Michael
989,"Is that what you’re… Okay. Oh, you sound a little… A little upset.","Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.",Michael
990,"Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know… I know how hard that was.",Do you? I don’t think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.,Michael
991,"Well, I’m glad you did it, Michael.",You’re glad?,Michael
992,"And so, good job. Good job.",Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good?,Michael
993,Yeah. Good job.,Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I’m gonna give myself a pat on the back.,Michael
994,Yup. Yes.,There. I’m doing it. Right there. Great.,Michael
995,"You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael’s really incredible at making decisions.","Yeah, blah, blah, blah.",Michael
996,"Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.","You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.",Michael
997,Did you ask me here for any specific reason?,"Uhh, yes, I did, here’s the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.",Michael
998,Why is that secret?,"Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.",Michael
999,"Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.","Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.",Michael
1000,It’s just last year you…,"Last year they were out of order, weren’t they Pam?",Michael
1001,"Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.","Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That’s pretty good. Um, actually, I’m sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.",Michael
1002,"Well, is that really a priority?","Is it a priority? Oh I don’t know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People’s legs are crushed under rubble. “Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can’t because we don’t have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn’t a priority.” Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That’s the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.",Michael
1003,Catch-22.,"Catch-22. Yes. Why don’t you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what’s your cell?",Michael
1004,Hello?,Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.,Michael
1005,Do you mean Neverland?,This is Tito.,Michael
1006,What?,Calling from…,Michael
1007,...,Pick up.,Michael
1008,Hello?,This is Mike Tyson.,Michael
1009,Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?,"Yeah, yeah, I don’t think that would happen.",Michael
1010,Because we’re friends.,Because I would kick his ass.,Michael
1011,"Well, Dwight’s a purple belt, so…",So? I’ve beaten up black belts.,Michael
1012,"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?","They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I’m just lucky I got out.",Michael
1013,"Sounds tough. When you’re a Jet, you’re a Jet all the way, right?",You were a Jet?,Michael
1014,Have you signed the expense reports yet?,"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t’s and dot some i’s. Alright, I’m going to be in my office if anybody needs me. Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That’s my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.",Michael
1015,I can’t. I just got a manicure.,"Oh, queer… eye. Queer eye. That’s a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.",Michael
1016,Just have Dwight punch you.,"Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.",Michael
1017,What belt are they?,"Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented ‘Armageddon’…",Michael
1018,No!,… he cried at the end of it. He did.,Michael
1019,"Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year’s Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.","Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?",Michael
1020,"Ok, I’ll punch you.","Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.",Michael
1021,Kiyah!,Fuuuaaaahhhhh… oohhhhh!,Michael
1022,Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?,Yeah. Thank you.,Michael
1023,Take this pen and stab me with it.,Go away.,Michael
1024,I just have a quick question.,"I haven’t signed them, ok?",Michael
1025,"No, it’s not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I’m probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?","Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can’t stop you from being mugged. He’s just not tough enough.",Michael
1026,He’s a purple belt. That’s really high.,"Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That’s ridiculous. I could murder him.",Michael
1027,"It’s just out there, you…","Oh, so that’s what they are saying?",Michael
1028,Yeah.,"Ok, alright, where is Dwight?",Michael
1029,"Uh, Kitchen.",Ok.,Michael
1030,What?,"Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.",Michael
1031,"I didn’t sucker punch you, Michael.","No, Really?",Michael
1032,"In case you remember, I was defending my honor… like a samurai.","Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.",Michael
1033,"Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!","Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.",Michael
1034,"No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.",Really?,Michael
1035,Yeah.,You know what? You’re just lucky that we are at work right now.,Michael
1036,"Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight’s dojo?","No, they must have class.",Michael
1037,"No, it’s free during the day. It’s fine.",Look…,Michael
1038,Michael…,"Hey, Toby.",Michael
1039,Any word on those time cards?,"I’ve got an idea: why don’t you leave right now. Why don’t you walk away from the room, ‘kay? Fine. We’ll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.",Michael
1040,"Uh, no, it’s not.",I think it is. A guy told me about that.,Michael
1041,"Actually, it’s a symbol for eternal discipline.",Oh.,Michael
1042,"Yes, Sensei!","Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn’t have any rules. Maybe one – no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.",Michael
1043,Hiii!,Hey!,Michael
1044,"Alright, break.",What the hell was that?,Michael
1045,Dwight – awarded a point.,No.,Michael
1046,Eat it!,"Alright, that’s the way you want it.",Michael
1047,Two more.,"Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.",Michael
1048,Sweep the leg.,"I’m comin’ atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.",Michael
1049,No.,I got his pants.,Michael
1050,No points for pants.,"Dwight, you have… No, you have something… God, you look like such an idiot!",Michael
1051,"Clean single kick, gentlemen.","Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.",Michael
1052,No holding.,"You can’t see. You can’t see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. Eight points. Nine points.",Michael
1053,"No, stop it! Come on! Michael.",Open your mouth.,Michael
1054,Fudge?,"Yeah… uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?",Michael
1055,Just put “The Hospital.” Contact number: just put 9-1-1.,"He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.",Michael
1056,I have the emergency contacts.,"Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I’ll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?",Michael
1057,"Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.","If you’re doing anything crazy, give me a shout.",Michael
1058,"Yeah, alright, I’ll um, see you Monday.","Alright, bye.",Michael
1059,"Michael, did you finish yet?","This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?",Michael
1060,I’m busy.,"Well, busier. Making the time.",Michael
1061,We want to go home.,"Well, you don’t even have anyone to go home to, Toby.",Michael
1062,The shipping place closes in a half hour.,"I know, but I’ve been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it’d might help me out. What do you say? Let’s gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.",Michael
1063,Of course.,And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.,Michael
1064,"Michael, I don’t know…","I know, I know, I know, I wouldn’t be offering it if I didn’t think you could handle it.",Michael
1065,I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.,"No, no, title change only.",Michael
1066,I’ll have Pam send out a memo.,"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let’s not tell anybody about this right now.",Michael
1067,Just a formality.,Absolutely but not really.,Michael

1069,"Thank you, Sensei.","And, ditto.",Michael
1070,Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?,"Yeah, I don’t think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I’m just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I’m talking about.",Michael
1071,Excuse me?,I’ve never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.,Michael

1073,Die. You just… You said it.,"Shut up, Dwight.",Michael
1074,"Sir, your shoes.",Yes.,Michael
1075,You’re gonna have to take them off. It’s a sign of respect.,"Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. Oh, stretchin’. I like to stay tight. Compact.",Michael
1076,Here’s your gear. Please put this on.,"Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?",Michael

1080,Are those purchase orders signed?,"Hey, Stanley. I don’t tell you how to do your job, do I? He…",Michael
1081,"Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don’t get these purchase orders…","Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That’s not how business works, okay? Okay.",Michael
1082,This is what you had Ryan do.,"Yes, under my tutelage.",Michael
1083,"Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?","If you didn’t badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.",Michael
1084,This is a projection of the county’s needs…,"Wow, graphs and charts, somebody’s really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today.",Michael
1085,"So when we get to the Radisson, I’d like to, um-",I changed it. To Chili’s.,Michael
1086,Excuse me?,"Radisson just gives out this vibe, “Oh, I’m doing business at the Radisson”. It’s kind of snooty. So.",Michael
1087,"You had no right to do that, Michael.",Here’s the thing. Chili’s is the new golf course. It’s where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.,Michael
1088,It said that.,It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.,Michael
1089,Alright. But you will let me run this meeting.,"Uh huh, uh huh. Power trip.",Michael

1091,"Michael, shouldn’t take more than an hour.",Well…,Michael
1092,Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?,"No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don’t get very much work done when I’m not here. That’s not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I’m not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we’re gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn’t matter, it’s an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao. Adios!",Michael

1133,"You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.",It’s true.,Michael
1134,Right down the street?,"Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin’. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It’s home, you know? I know the challenges this county’s up against. Here’s the thing about those discount suppliers. They don’t care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we’re all gone, they jack up the prices.",Michael
1135,I know.,It’s bad.,Michael
1136,It’s terrible.,"It, you know what, it really is.",Michael
1137,"I don’t know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they’re expecting me to make cuts.","Well, corporate’s gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?",Michael

1144,Did you do her?,This is none of your affair because she is your boss-,Michael
1145,And she is your boss.,"And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don’t think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. Jan, I defend your honor. Is that all?",Michael
1146,Hmm…,"Doctor David Friendly’s Egg Yolk Diet. It’s, it’s kind of unique. It’s just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese. And, um, what you do, you don’t just have the egg yolks, it’s not like a Rocky thing. You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers and I, it’s just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth. I don’t even, I don’t even use a plate anymore. Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg I know, I know! But you know what? It’s perfect. I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what? Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing. The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this… I, well, the melon baller was my idea.",Michael
1147,Most of that is good.,"Not today, Kevin. Cannot be around carbs today. You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?",Michael

1156,I’ll see you in ten minutes.,42897. Ok.,Michael
1157,Thank you.,And a woman-,Michael
1158,"Oh, no.","And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. “Michael, it’s Jan. I guess I missed you. I’ll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it’s understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.” First impressions?",Michael
1159,She missed you.,"But then she goes on to say “that will be our only topic of discussion”. That doesn’t mean anything, those are just words.",Michael
1160,I have one idea of what it means.,"Ok. Yeah, what, what?",Michael
1161,Well I don’t think you’re gonna be very happy with this.,"Ohhh, great. Well, now I’m in a terrible mood. Let’s do your performance review-",Michael
1162,"Because she’s conflicted. She has to be professional, but she’s fighting feelings… for you.","Ah, why, that’s great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?",Michael
1163,"Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.","Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let’s listen to that again. “Michael, it’s Jan. I guess I missed you”.",Michael
1164,Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.,Really?,Michael
1165,"Oh, yes. Let’s listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses.","God, Stanley, that’s frickin’ brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry.",Michael
1166,"Oh, no, that’s ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact.",No kidding.,Michael
1167,Michael?,Yeah?,Michael
1168,Jan’s on the phone for you.,"Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.",Michael
1169,Michael.,Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?,Michael
1170,I am returning your many calls.,"Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili’s.",Michael
1171,"No. No, we won’t be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.","Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili’s.",Michael
1172,"Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.",Oh.,Michael
1173,I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.,Been thinking about you.,Michael
1174,"Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.","Um, I don’t see how that’s unprofessional. Just-",Michael
1175,Michael.,Yep.,Michael
1176,Are the cameras with you…,No.,Michael
1177,…in your office?,"They are not. Yes, they are. That’s my girlfriend.",Michael
1178,Sorry.,That’s unfortunate. How ’bout the suggestion box? There’s tons of ideas in there.,Michael
1179,What suggestion box?,"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there’s prizes?",Michael
1180,"Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.","Why don’t you find it and tell people to get theirs… never mind, I’ll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson’s coming, very soon, and so, we’re going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.",Michael
1181,Don’t you mean constructive criticism?,What did I say?,Michael
1182,You said “constructive complements”; that doesn’t make any sense.,"Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. ‘K?",Michael
1183,Sure.,"Hi, Jan. How are you?",Michael
1184,I’m good; how are you?,Good to see you.,Michael
1185,Nice to see you.,"Ok. Ok, why don’t we just step into my office? We’re gonna go in here.",Michael
1186,Can we please go in your office?,"Yep, right after you. Apres-vous. No calls.",Michael
1187,Thank you.,It’s nice to see you.,Michael
1188,"Nice to see you too, Michael.",Really?,Michael
1189,Not like that.,"Oh, well.",Michael
1190,"You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I’m not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.",Alright.,Michael
1191,Period.,Yep.,Michael
1192,Do we understand each other.,Absolutely.,Michael
1193,So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?,"No, no, no, I finished all of that. I’m very fast. I’m not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma’am. But I do say thank ya ma’am. But, I’m, I’m not like wham-bam. Not that there’s anything wrong with wham-bam. If it’s consensual. We’re talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?",Michael
1194,No.,"This is a business question. It’s nothing personal, I promise.",Michael
1195,Fine.,Are you wearing a new perfume today?,Michael
1196,How is that a business question?,"Well, you’re wearing it at the office. And it, I’m sorry, but no offense, but it’s really sexy.",Michael
1197,"Michael, it’s time for the suggestion box meeting.",I’m kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn’t interrupt.,Michael
1198,You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.,"I did not, not, not use those words.",Michael
1199,"Uh, I’d like to sit in on that meeting is it happening right now?","No, it’s in like ten minutes.",Michael
1200,I thought you read these every week.,"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally.",Michael
1201,It happens occasionally.,"And, um, one down. Next suggestion: “we need better outreach for employees fighting depression”. Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression.",Michael
1202,"That sounds serious, Michael.","Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?",Michael
1203,Tom?,Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.,Michael
1204,Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. Tom? Pow.,"Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion.",Michael
1205,Next suggestion.,"Arrr, dooby dooby do. “You need to do something about your B.O.”",Michael
1206,You need to do something about your B.O.,"Ok, I don’t know who this suggestion is meant for, but it’s more of a personal suggestion and it’s not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.",Michael
1207,Aren’t the suggestions meant for you?,"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.",Michael
1208,"Uh, Michael, he wasn’t inferring, he was implying. You were inferring.","Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we’re on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it’s something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we’ve learned this, let’s continue. See, this is good, we’re learning and we’re figuring some stuff out. “You need to do something about your coffee breath”-",Michael
1209,You need-,Ok.,Michael
1210,To do something about-,"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don’t think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.",Michael
1211,Sometimes you talk to us real close.,"Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-",Michael
1212,"Well, when you have coffee breath-",I’ll work on that-,Michael
1213,It’s hard.,"Let’s keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody’s piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don’t wanna have to read these tomorrow.",Michael
1214,"Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?","Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.",Michael
1215,Next suggestion.,"“Don’t sl-“, ok, that’s blank Don’t, just put it-",Michael
1216,"I can’t, I can’t-",I don’t understand why you’re so upset.,Michael
1217,Please sit down.,Let me ask you-,Michael
1218,You’re gonna sit here and I’m gonna go sit over there.,"Ok, let me ask you this.",Michael
1219,"Please, sit yourself down.",Let me ask you something.,Michael
1220,"What, Michael.",Where did you get your outfit?,Michael
1221,"Because nothing did, Michael. It, I’m not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same",Look-,Michael
1222,Michael?,Oh my God…,Michael
1223,Great.,What do you want Dwight?,Michael
1224,I am ready for my performance review.,"Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye.",Michael
1225,"Is this how you’ve been conducting all the reviews, Michael?","You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.",Michael
1226,"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",Why on earth would we give you a raise?,Michael
1227,"That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word: dedication. I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. Even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays.",You do? How do you get in?,Michael
1228,That’s a serious offense!,That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man’s heart.,Michael
1229,I’d also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.,"Ok, third wheel, why don’t you do that?",Michael
1230,"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.","That was deer!? Gross, oh!",Michael
1231,You liked it!,"Oh, did not!",Michael
1232,"It’s a delicacy. And you know what? It’s an aphrodisiac. So when we’re done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.","What do you say, Jan?",Michael
1233,"Ok! Here’s what I’m gonna do: I’m gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.","Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.",Michael
1234,"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said “Dad, you have no idea what I’m capable of”.",That’s from Superman?,Michael
1235,I’m heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.,Wait.,Michael
1236,‘K?,"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?",Michael
1237,"Michael, now is not the time or the place.","Ok, so you’re saying that there is a different time or place?",Michael
1238,"No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.","Well, ok, well never as in ‘never ever ever’, or never as in there’s still a chance?",Michael
1239,"Never, for me, always means ‘never ever ever.’","I just want to know, from the horse’s mouth, what is the dealio?",Michael
1240,"Michael, it has nothing-",Am I too short?,Michael
1241,"With your looks, ok? It’s your personality. I mean, you’re obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don’t agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.",Really?,Michael
1242,"Really. You’re, you’re, you’re a great guy, ok?","I appreciate that, thank you.",Michael
1243,"And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-","No, I wasn’t, I didn’t cry-",Michael
1244,"At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I’m looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but… ok?",So my looks have nothing to do with it?,Michael
1245,Ummm… no idea.,"Never missed a day, my ass.",Michael
1246,"Michael, I don’t know what to say.","Um, you’re in accounting…",Michael
1247,"Yes, I’m in accounting and I’m sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.","So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I’m a big believer in people being here more.",Michael
1248,I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.,All right.,Michael
1249,Period.,Yup.,Michael
1250,Do we understand each other?,Absolutely.,Michael
1251,"So, that’s… It’s great.","Yes, it is.",Michael
1252,Yeah. You have fun?,"Yes, I did.",Michael
1253,Did you go to first base?,"Hell, yeah.",Michael
1254,"Oh, yeah?",Yeah.,Michael
1255,Did you go to second?,What?,Michael
1256,Second.,"Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but…",Michael
1257,"Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?","Um, yup, wait, yes.",Michael
1258,Pop-up?,"No, there… Later there was.",Michael
1259,Really?,Yes.,Michael
1260,"So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I’m saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn’t he?","I didn’t, you know, it was… It was dark, for one thing.",Michael
1261,Pushing on.,"It’s next. Just keep it. “Look on the supply shelf.” What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?",Michael
1262,Yeah. It’s another note.,"Okay, yeah.",Michael
1263,“Look on the windshield.”,Okay.,Michael
1264,He can’t hear you?,"Okay, field trip’s over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?",Michael
1265,Come on. Let’s get back to this.,"All right, don’t break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?",Michael
1266,I’m back.,Christ Almighty.,Michael
1267,“Look under the sink in the men’s room.”,"All right, next suggestion.",Michael
1268,Next suggestion.,"“Don’t…” Okay, that’s blank. Don’t. Just…",Michael
1269,"Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.",Well…,Michael
1270,"The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that’s it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it’s just not true, okay? It’s not true. So… Is everyone straight on that?",Crystal.,Michael
1271,There’s one more suggestion.,How pleasant. You can…,Michael

1279,"Okay, how dare you do that?",I didn’t do that. I… Maybe he called me.,Michael
1280,"Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?","Ex-husband, you have to let it go.",Michael
1281,Are we in danger?,"There’s no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody.",Michael
1282,That just means you have to enter your password.,Oh…,Michael
1283,"What’s your password, Michael?","Oh, umm…",Michael
1284,"Oh, it’s 1-2-3.",Yes.,Michael
1285,Mi-,AH! Guh-oood.,Michael

1288,You have to tell me.,I don’t have to tell you anything.,Michael

1429,What is Yankee Swap?,"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person’s gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else’s gift or choose a new gift.",Michael
1430,"Yeah, we call it White Elephant.","Well, I call it fun!",Michael
1431,Why are we doing this?,Because it’s better. Because it’s more special.,Michael

1437,"You and me, Michael. Yes!",Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?,Michael
1438,Maybe because you hated her present so much.,Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it’s a success and I’m the one who ended up with Dwight’s stupid paintball pellets.,Michael
1439,And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.,"Well, I didn’t. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!",Michael

1819,"It’s just that we’re really swamped over here, Michael.","Oh, and I’m not? Why would you say that? Because I’m having fun? You guys just are workin’ for the weekend, aren’t you? I’m workin’ for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we’re gonna do. I’m gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I’m gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?",Michael
1820,Yeah!,"Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I’m going to … … I’m gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.

1826,Paper business.,"Yeah, paper business. Is this done?",Michael
1827,Nope.,"Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.",Michael
1828,That doesn’t seem fair.,"You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I’ll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just… I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.",Michael
1829,But you’re the one who picked today.,I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I’m talkin’ about.,Michael
1830,That’s not what a hate crime is.,"Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I… you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we’d be done . Very well. Then you are all punished.",Michael
1831,What’s our punishment?,You’re all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. No. NO!,Michael
1832,Sure. He hired me. How’s he doing?,How would I know?,Michael
1833,I thought you might.,My biggest fear is turning into him.,Michael
1834,"Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.","I wasn’t talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?",Michael
1835,Yeah. Should we go upstairs?,"Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don’t wanna be up there right now.",Michael
1836,"So, what’s the problem with my pension?","Oh, no, no, no. You’re good. It was clerical. You’re good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.",Michael
1837,"Well, what was done?","I didn’t get a good look at… it, but it smells horrible.",Michael
1838,"Yeah, somebody once did that in my office.",Really?,Michael
1839,Yeah.,"Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?",Michael
1840,You can’t expect to be friends with everybody.,Well… s-sure I can.,Michael
1841,No. They’ll always think of you as a boss first.,Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.,Michael
1842,I’m not sure that ever happens.,"Well, okay. Different management styles.",Michael
1843,"Hello, yes. I’m looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.",Who is this? How did you get this number?,Michael

1846,It was pretty big.,Really?,Michael
1847,Yeah.,Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it?,Michael
1848,Left it in the middle of your office.,"Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?",Michael
1849,...,Are you kidding me? Oh!,Michael
1850,Special delivery!,"That was Packer! Oh, you’re… you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar… Oh, God! Of course it was you.",Michael
1851,"Sit on the throne, Michael.","Oh. Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!",Michael
1852,"20 cartons of it’s coming, on it’s way.",What’s going on? Anything here?,Michael
1853,Yes.,"Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or…",Michael
1854,A sale.,Ah. Small?,Michael
1855,Big.,Huge?,Michael
1856,Just big.,Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or…,Michael
1857,"Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it’s alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.",What was that?,Michael
1858,What?,"You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?",Michael
1859,"You’re the one who trained me, Michael.","Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?",Michael
1860,You most certainly did not.,"No, I did not.",Michael
1861,What can I do better?,"Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.",Michael
1862,I’m not good at jokes.,Do you know a joke?,Michael
1863,My cousin Mose told me a joke.,Call a client right now.,Michael
1864,Okay.,And tell him the joke.,Michael
1865,I will.,Strike while the iron’s hot. A joke always works.,Michael
1866,"Yes, Howard Gruber, please.",Just sell it.,Michael
1867,"Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I’m calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can’t think? A nun who has a beet for a head. … No, I’m Catholic, too.",Give me the phone.,Michael
1868,I understand.,Give me the phone.,Michael
1869,"If I was offensive in any way, I…",Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.,Michael
1870,Humor works in…,The old one two. Let’s do it.,Michael
1871,…crazy ways. I’m going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. Howard Gruber. It’s Howard Gruber.,"Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he’s a little… Little dim. He’s the janitor’s brother, so…",Michael
1872,That’s not true.,"Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can’t even find their way to work? That is Dwight.",Michael
1873,He’s my best customer.,"What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.",Michael
1874,"But that’s my sale. This is my sale, Michael!","Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I’m glad it timed out that way.",Michael
1875,"Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So…","Hey, what’s going on?",Michael
1876,Michael… I thought we agreed you wouldn’t be here.,Yeah… I… You know what… I… I… I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.,Michael
1877,What are you doing?,"Hold… Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today’s woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads…",Michael
1878,Michael.,"No, just uh… you have come a long way, baby. But I just… just want to keep it within reason.",Michael
1879,Michael.,They did this up in Albany…,Michael
1880,You are not allowed in this session.,And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so…,Michael
1881,Now you’re really not allowed in this session.,"Well, I’m their boss, so I feel like…",Michael
1882,I’m your boss.,Anybody want any coffee or…,Michael
1883,Yeah!,That’s what I’m talking about!,Michael
1884,"I don’t know what you’re doing here, Michael,",Just having a little ‘guys in the workplace’ thing.,Michael
1885,… but it’s very destructive.,Why can’t boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?,Michael
1886,"Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?",We have nowhere else Jan. This…,Michael
1887,"Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.","OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There’s another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there’s another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man’s work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.",Michael
1888,My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.,"You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There’s Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And… uh, she’s our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.",Michael
1889,Why?,Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina… Roy…,Michael
1890,I don’t understand.,Roy and Pam. It’s a Ram. It’s a Ram thing.,Michael
1891,"Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.","Oh… well… okay… yeah, you know what? I don’t think… You.. You’re… My job sucks compared to this. I don’t think you’d like it up there.",Michael
1892,The experience…,Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?,Michael
1893,"It’s dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.","Hey, you’re going to, going to hurt yourself.",Michael
1894,Mike.,Stand clear.,Michael
1895,Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.,"I’m fine, I’m fine. I’m fine.",Michael
1896,"Look, would ya… look.","Oh, oh, oh! We’ll get somebody to clean that up.",Michael
1897,"Dammit, Michael!",We ought to have this thing serviced.,Michael
1898,"Hey, do you want me to go?","No, why? Why would I… ? You could…",Michael
1899,I’ll go.,Stay or…,Michael
1900,My priority is safety.,OK.,Michael
1901,"So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.","OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh…",Michael
1902,Uh uh uh. Don’t shush me.,I… That was just…,Michael
1903,That bothers me too.,I was breathing.,Michael
1904,Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.,"I hate shushing. You know, that’s the thing! What the… ok… what is our beef as human men.",Michael
1905,"You know that’s a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?",OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That’s what guys do… and we love it.,Michael
1906,"Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We’re not millionaires.",I feel you.,Michael
1907,"You say we’re the same, but we get compensated very differently.",Yes.,Michael
1908,We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder,"Ah, you do. So…",Michael
1909,Like next to no benefits.,I know. God! What is that?,Michael
1910,Exactly.,"It blows. It blows, man. Gah…",Michael
1911,That’s what I’m talking about.,"No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.",Michael
1912,"Man, see… That’s what I’ve been sayin’, man. We need to do this finally.",You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union… of guys.,Michael
1913,In my truck.,Dockworker’s?,Michael
1914,"Come on, man.",Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,Michael
1915,"Union! Union, yeah.",The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.,Michael
1916,Are you with us Mike?,Yeah-es.,Michael
1917,Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I’m sure that all of you have felt that before…,"This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna… Can I help you? Um… I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points…",Michael
1918,What? A union! What…,Don’t get hysterical.,Michael
1919,"The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think… the… pros… are… here?",Don’t talk to me that way please. Just… they’re going to want to hear this from you.,Michael
1920,"You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.",But we’re bonding down there!,Michael
1921,That’s too bad.,I mean I just don’t want to have to tell them something they’re not going to want to hear.,Michael
1922,I don’t want to…,Ok. Come on Jan. After all we’ve been through…,Michael
1923,Michael! Michael! Michael!,We have a history…,Michael
1924,Michael.,…between us.,Michael
1925,Don’t say another word.,I won’t,Michael
1926,Get yourself down stairs.,I’m just saying we have something… Ok. Whatever.,Michael
1927,Did you take care of the situation?,"Yuh, yuh, yes! I… I have essentially…",Michael
1928,Excuse me.,I have essentially. Yes. I’ve taken some…,Michael
1929,This is not a good idea right here.,You did uh… okay.,Michael
1930,Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.,"Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.",Michael
1931,"Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh… hold, please.","Oh! I don’t know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.",Michael
1932,You did?,"And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I’m a little overwhelmed.",Michael
1933,Yeah.,There’s a lot of choices. You got to help me here.,Michael
1934,Okay.,Which one of these is coolest? What do you think?,Michael
1935,How about that one?,"No, no.",Michael
1936,"Oh, that one was good.","Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, “I am so lame.” Know which one I want? There’s one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It’s like… You know what I’m talking about?",Michael

1941,Yeah.,Yup.,Michael
1942,Okay.,All right.,Michael
1943,And you want me to come with you.,Nope. The opposite of that.,Michael
1944,I will stay here and run things on this end.,"Ok, good.",Michael
1945,Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you’re in New York?,"I probably will, why do you ask?",Michael
1946,"Well… It’s Valentine’s Day, and you guys, you know…",Yeah.,Michael
1947,Screwed.,...,Michael
1948,That’s OK.,Alright.,Michael
1949,"The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.","Dude, I’m gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!",Michael

1954,"Not much, they’re uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we’re just waiting for the presentations.","Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and…",Michael
1955,She ain’t my boss dude. I don’t work for that bitch.,"Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that’s not. Cool it.",Michael
1956,What? You like Jan? How can you,"Maybe because she’s my girlfriend. Was, or not my girlfriend. She’s… we hooked up and…",Michael
1957,You hooked up with Jan?,"You know, months ago, just once, It’s, just stupid. Just forget it,",Michael
1958,"Yeah, let’s change the subject.","Yeah, yeah.",Michael

1960,"OK, Michael.","What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more.",Michael
1961,"What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more.","Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that’s the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we’re not just in the paper business, we’re in the people business. Let’s meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley’s dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark’s of the foundation of the business we’re hoping to build our bases on.",Michael
1962,"And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it’s like to walk a mile in Oscar’s shoes. Or try on Phyllis’ pants. Maybe even one of Angela’s famous brownies. And you’ll know, that you’re home.",Questions?,Michael
1963,"Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.","Yes, thank you.",Michael
1964,"But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch’s performance, so do you have that information as well?","Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm…",Michael
1965,"NO, NO I’m not, I’m not, I just… I just don’t know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we’re all gonna get fired.",No you’re not.,Michael
1966,"Yeah, Michael – the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just can’t believe that you told everybody and we didn’t even sleep together.","Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So…",Michael
1967,"Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It’s over. Do you understand?",Yes. I’m sorry. I will fix this. I’ll talk to him. I’ll talk to David.,Michael
1968,"Surely, you cannot be serious?",I am serious. And don’t call me Shirley. Airplane.,Michael
1969,You understand this is a very serious situation.,"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here’s the deal. It’s my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.",Michael
1970,You made a joke?,"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he’s not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.",Michael
1971,Well I don’t need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss…,"I know. It was borderline at best and… And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I’m really sorry. It will never happen again.",Michael
1972,"Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.","Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.",Michael
1973,"Oh, no, it’s OK. So, uh, Happy valentine’s Day.","Yeah, Happy Valentine’s Day.",Michael
1974,"Yes, sure. Mr. Scott, you can head to the conference room. The other managers are already there.",Great. Thank you.,Michael
1975,Hey Scott. Hey. Hey! Hey! Come here! Come here! I want to talk to you. Come here!,You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.,Michael
1976,They are either going to say yes… or no.,Could go either way. We don’t know what they are going to say.,Michael
1977,Think it through.,Have to think it through. Because if they say no…,Michael
1978,Can we not?,"No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don’t like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.",Michael
1979,Still want that.,"Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys… Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.",Michael
1980,Fumble! Yaaah!,"Hey, Dwight.",Michael
1981,Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!,You all right Ryan?,Michael
1982,Yeah.,Pam!,Michael
1983,Ha! I don’t get it.,Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?,Michael
1984,"Well, it’s not really a big speech. You still coming right?","Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um… And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.",Michael
1985,"What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, “Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very…”",That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.,Michael
1986,I can’t do this.,"That’s because you’re incapable of doing it because you don’t know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there’s no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.",Michael
1987,"Oh, okay.",But I can teach you enough so that you don’t embarrass me or the company.,Michael
1988,"Okay, deal! I’ll do whatever you say. No questions asked.","Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.",Michael
1989,I’ll try and think of one. When…,Don’t. Don’t try and think of a question to humor me. Just… try not to be such an idiot.,Michael
1990,Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?,Insult.,Michael
1991,Saleswoman has a vagina.,"It’s a joke, Dwight. It’s not a Sex Ed class.",Michael
1992,But I’m right?,"Yeah, you’re right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman… is boobs!",Michael
1993,Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?,I do. Both of them.,Michael
1994,Could I have a copy of one of them?,"No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn’t matter what you say. It just matters that you’re saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.",Michael
1995,Yeah!,Congratulations.,Michael
1996,That is so great about the bonus!,"No, no! It’s not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They’ll eat it up. They’re a great audience.",Michael
1997,This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.,He’s kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don’t know why because it wasn’t funny… and it was just horrible.,Michael
1998,Michael?,Yeah.,Michael
1999,You said we were getting bonuses.,All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let’s go. Let’s do it.,Michael
2000,You mean Toastmasters?,"Pam! I’m public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.",Michael
2001,Can I go?,Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.,Michael
2002,Been to Amsterdam.,Oh ho hokay. You know what? That’s not a toast. You’re not standing up.,Michael
2003,"Michael, can you explain?","Well, it’s mostly made up. So…",Michael
2004,...,"Dwight, they called your name.",Michael
2005,"No, I can’t… I ca…",All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I’m going to cover for you. All right!,Michael
2006,...,"Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",Michael
2007,...,Good luck. That is a tough crowd.,Michael
2008,"Ok, thanks. There you are. What happened?",I got thirsty. How’d it go?,Michael
2009,It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.,You would not believe what happened here.,Michael
2010,What? Something happened?,"Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.",Michael
2011,Weird.,"Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like ‘I don’t have my ID, please give me one.’ And he was like ‘I can’t do that. I can’t serve you.’",Michael
2012,Con artist.,She might have been. So she says ‘Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I’ll show you my ID.’ She hasn’t come back yet. She’s probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?,Michael
2013,"And what a lot of people don’t understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.","That’s it? You’re going to end with “etcetera”? Okay, what’s this big organizational system that…",Michael
2014,"Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?","That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.",Michael
2015,It is?,It’s your delivery…,Michael
2016,What is?,Our biggest worry.,Michael
2017,I don’t follow.,"My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That’s why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you.",Michael
2018,"Oh, God!","See, I have your attention now, don’t I? You’re scared, but now you’re ready to learn.",Michael
2019,"Well, that didn’t go well.","No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We’ll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.",Michael
2020,Her nephew’s in Iraq.,Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.,Michael
2021,"Yes, but they are both in danger.","Yeah, well, you know what? We need to… All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let’s go.",Michael
2022,What are we supposed to talk about?,Anything your heart desires.,Michael
2023,I would like to toast to the good fortune I’ve been having lately…,Louder!,Michael
2024,"I, uh, I met a man and I’m totally in love, and that’s a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts…","Good. Good, good, good. That’s good. Now see, that’s not so hard, right? All right. Who’s next? Who are we going to… Ryan. Ryan’s next.",Michael
2025,Why am I next? I thought we’d go in order?,"Don’t be shy, shy boy. Don’t be shy. Get up there.",Michael
2026,"Way to go, Ryan!","Stop! Stop! Stop! That’s, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It’s certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so…",Michael
2027,"Oh, no, I don’t think this is it.","Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.",Michael
2028,"Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I’m so in love with her.",You’re weird.,Michael
2029,"No, no, no. It’s totally normal, ’cause she’s not a Cylon or anything. She’s just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.",Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don’t know. There we go.,Michael
2030,"Oh, I have more.",Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w—,Michael
2031,"Oh, Michael. You can’t be nasty today. ‘Cause of the…","… Oh, God is that today?",Michael
2032,Don’t you think you should say something?,They’re cool.,Michael
2033,"Michael, I think that as the boss you should really—","Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I’m Michael Scott, and… I… am in charge of this place… ahh, what’ll make you… understand… I am… like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.",Michael
2034,That’s Batman.,"Okay, I’m Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?",Michael
2035,The ocean.,I work with a bunch of nerds.,Michael
2036,"Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.","Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you’ve really grown up. You know what? Don’t mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the… frat boys away from her.",Michael
2037,I’m in eighth grade.,Oh.,Michael
2038,She’s in middle school.,"Yeah, middle school’s amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.",Michael
2039,"Um, fif–well, fifty… I… over ordered because they had a back order.",Okay.,Michael
2040,Sasha.,Nice to meet you.,Michael
2041,Ooh!,"Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I’m the conductor. But I’m sort of the conductor of the office here, right? You want to try?",Michael
2042,Sure.,"All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu…camonga!",Michael
2043,"That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat… a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it’s called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs— are you listening, Sasha? Right? And ‘ere they dream when he’s about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!",Dwight! Dwight!,Michael
2044,There’s a photo…,What the hell are you reading to them?,Michael
2045,"These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these—","Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don’t want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.",Michael

2047,Nazi was a fascist movement…,Don’t!,Michael
2048,…from the 1930’s…,"Don’t! Don’t! Don’t talk about Nazis in front of— you know what? They’re going to have nightmares, so why don’t you just shut it?",Michael
2049,I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.,Why don’t you just leave? Okay?,Michael
2050,"Bye, Mister Poop.","Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?",Michael
2051,So… you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.,"No, we don’t actually cut the paper. That’s a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.",Michael
2052,That’s not fair.,"Yes it is, well, w-w–you need someone in the middle to facilitate…",Michael
2053,You’re just a middleman.,I’m not just a middle… man…,Michael
2054,"Wait, why doesn’t the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?","You are describing Office Depot, and they’re kind of running us out of business.",Michael
2055,We have better service than they do!,"…There’s Creed! Let’s take a look at what he’s doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of… something. Right?",Michael
2056,That is correct.,Say hi to the kids.,Michael

2059,"Th-the hair covers it, mostly.","No no no, we’re not gonna see— we’re not gonna see the four toed… Creed, okay?",Michael
2060,No way.,It’s true. I did.,Michael
2061,Really?,I am totally serious. There was a show called ‘Fundle Bundle’ and I was the star.,Michael
2062,What?!,"It’s true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. Ryan, can you come here a second? I would like you to go to my mother’s house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement.

2074,Why not?,"Uh, just never happened.",Michael
2075,"So, do you have any kids?","Uh, nope.",Michael
2076,Do you have a girlfriend?,I do okay.,Michael
2077,Was Chet Montgomery cool back then?,Yes.,Michael
2078,Even I have a girlfriend.,"Okay! Alright, okay.",Michael
2079,So you didn’t get to be what you wanted to be.,"…I guess not… you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza… and I’m going to go do my work. Bye.",Michael
2080,I think these belong to you.,"Oh, that’s okay, she can keep those.",Michael
2081,"Believe me, she has enough toys… she doesn’t need your watch.",Thank you.,Michael
2082,Is everything okay?,You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.,Michael
2083,Mmhmm.,"Tell me something honestly, do you… think… that it is too late for me to have kids?",Michael
2084,"Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.",What about…,Michael
2085,Not Jan.,…Jan. Kay.,Michael
2086,"If you really want to have kids, I— I guess you could somehow… foster parent, or something.",…Or biologically.,Michael
2087,Somehow.,"Thanks, that’s, no, that… that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I…",Michael

2091,I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.,…did slowly go by… and feed… them on your dreams…,Michael
2092,My theory is that…,…The one they picked… the one you’ll know by… don’t you ever ask them why… if I told you would cry… you never look at them and sigh… and know they love you…,Michael
2093,"And they do, your parents, love you very much.",One more time. You…,Michael
2094,I got some muscles. You wanna see the muscles? Bam! Look at that.,"Hey, don’t touch him, please!",Michael
2095,Can I have a quarter? I promise I’ll pay you back.,Sure.,Michael
2096,Can I have a dollar? Then I can buy chips and a drink.,Okay. There you go.,Michael
2097,Who is this guy again?,Don’t worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are… the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.,Michael
2098,Who uses calling cards anymore?,"You know what? That’s a nice attitude, Ryan, I’m just helping you invest in your future, my friend.",Michael
2099,This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.,Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!,Michael
2100,"Didn’t you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?","You know what, Toby?

Alright.",Michael
2101,"No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?","Alright, let me explain. Again. Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we’re all going to make. It’s not a pyramid scheme, it is a… it’s not even a scheme per se, it’s… … I have to go make a call.",Michael
2102,Happy birthday Michael.,Oh ho ho! What?,Michael
2103,I said happy birthday.,Thank you! That’s really nice.,Michael

2177,"“For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and…”","Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, “I have cancer.”",Michael
2178,“The skin is the largest organ of the body.”,"Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.",Michael
2179,"Yeah, let’s do it that way.","Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you’re totally harshing the office mellow.",Michael
2180,…to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.,Narc!,Michael
2181,If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.,I wasn’t attempting to compliment you.,Michael
2182,"Well, you have…","Uuf, well…",Michael
2183,…because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have…,Okay…,Michael
2184,…and I am very proud of being a narc.,"Why don’t you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! Dude, where’s my office? I totally lost it, ’cause I was half-baked. Smokin’ doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin’ doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!",Michael
2185,"Well, your office is behind you.",Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?,Michael
2186,"That is so good, Michael","Remember the narc bit? Uh-oh, who’s in trouble?",Michael
2187,Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone’s urine.,Waa… what? What are you talking about?,Michael
2188,No you can’t do that.,"I can do that, it is my office.",Michael
2189,"No you cannot. It has to be official, and it",Hmmm. Ha. Alright. Great.,Michael
2190,You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.,"No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, “Hey, you know what, he’s right? What he’s doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.”",Michael
2191,Where did you get these facts?,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",Michael
2192,They are not.,Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,Michael
2193,"No, I don’t. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants.","Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",Michael
2194,"Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.",Yes it is.,Michael
2195,"No it’s not. It’s a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.","Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? In addition to Toby’s urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",Michael
2196,You can’t do that.,"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",Michael
2197,That’s not random.,"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I’m going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.",Michael
2198,I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.,Really?,Michael
2199,"Uh, hmmm.","Jim it’s okay. You can t… This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. It’s okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. Oh, he’s doing it, okay. It’s okay. Oh. Okay, are you sure? That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. Okay, well.",Michael
2200,"No, you will be tested.","Yes, I will not be.",Michael
2201,You will be. That is the law according to the rules.,"Okay, well Dwight just know that I’ve been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn’t planning on going to the bathroom and I don’t even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.",Michael
2202,What kind of filing?,Just forget it. Just the urine.,Michael
2203,That goes directly to the tester.,Just. I need your urine.,Michael
2204,Like in a cup?,"Yes in a cup, we’re not animals, Dwight.",Michael
2205,For what purpose?,It’s none of your business.,Michael
2206,Then I refuse.,"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",Michael
2207,Are you serious?,I need clean urine for the lady.,Michael
2208,But that’s illegal.,"Don’t think of it that way. It’s like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there’s no controlling it. It just… goes",Michael
2209,Not my urine.,A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.,Michael
2210,Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?,"No, just look. Look. Just… just fill up the cup.",Michael
2211,That’s great.,What’s wrong? Where’s your costume?,Michael
2212,It’s a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.,Why? Wha…,Michael
2213,Really?,"Yes, sir.",Michael
2214,That’s fantastic because I’ve always felt that the security here sucked .,So you wanna? Thanks.,Michael
2215,"Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.",Okay.,Michael
2216,I don’t think so.,Good.,Michael
2217,"Thank you, Michael.",No. Oh. Uh…,Michael
2218,I need to go over some details with you.,"Alright. Well, Thank you.",Michael
2219,How?,Exactly. I know. It’s amazing.,Michael
2220,"I have some hemp ropes at my house, they’re really strong…",Shut… Shut it. No. Just… Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.,Michael
2221,Excuse me?,"No, no! Your instinct. That… Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don’t! That’s, that’s… Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.",Michael
2222,"It’s not me, either.","No? okay, fine.",Michael
2223,"Michael, I’m gonna get going. I really don’t think I need to be in this meeting.","Okay, well, I really think that…",Michael
2224,Has she been on the phone the whole time?,Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers’ quarrel.,Michael
2225,Nice.,"Okay, let’s get personal for a second, shall we?",Michael
2226,just drink a lot of water.,Well…,Michael
2227,You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.,"I don’t… Let’s just not talk about it, okay?",Michael
2228,Thank you.,That is… who makes that?,Michael
2229,"Um, I don’t…",Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,Michael
2230,"It’s like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he’d freak out! He’d freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels… it’s… and I’m supposed to work there. I’m supposed…",What’s the dealio?,Michael
2231,"Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer’s back there today.",What’s the problem?,Michael
2232,Since Christmas.,"So what, you’re having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",Michael
2233,"Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?",Yes.,Michael
2234,Here’s how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.,Yeah?,Michael
2235,These things just have a way of working themselves out.,Okay.,Michael
2236,"It’s like if you write someone a letter, when you’re really angry… they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.",What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So…,Michael
2237,Okay.,Okay… what?,Michael
2238,That was the right decision for me and my marriage.,"Yeah, well… that’s not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part… assuming we don’t get downsized. Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?",Michael
2239,Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.,"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",Michael
2240,What’s the next one?,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You… you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",Michael
2241,Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is – win/win or whatever?,"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.",Michael
2242,"I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.","Come on, seriously, that?",Michael
2243,"I don’t like looking at it. It’s creepy, and in bad taste, and it’s just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It’s kitsch. It’s the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I’m talking about the…","Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let’s see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",Michael
2244,Win!,"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.",Michael
2245,That’s… no…,"Okay… well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",Michael
2246,"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?","Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win – make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose – take the poster down, compromise – Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is… make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",Michael
2247,"But, it…",It is done!,Michael
2248,You solved it?,Yes.,Michael
2249,"Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out.",Are those all the other complains?,Michael
2250,Mmm-Hm.,I would like to see those please.,Michael
2251,I… I can’t do that.,"You can’t do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",Michael
2252,That…,Okay. There! No more conflict. I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. All right… is that it?,Michael
2253,Nice.,You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.,Michael
2254,You already did me.,"That’s what she said. The thing is, Angela… you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does “redacted” mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked “redacted”… ?",Michael
2255,"Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.","Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",Michael
2256,Um… let’s move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let’s do it! And … okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",Michael
2257,"Wait, what did it say?","Uh… ”Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn’t she do that at home?” Who else? Why don’t we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",Michael
2258,"Fine, I’ll take your name off. So no one will know.",Makin’ progress. Yes?,Michael
2259,Dwight tried to kiss me.,What?!,Michael
2260,Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!,You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,Michael
2261,Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door?,"Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela’s giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",Michael
2262,"No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.","And… also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",Michael
2263,We sit close.,Oh… ok.,Michael
2264,I guess so…,"Okay, well… all settled, then.",Michael
2265,"Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays…",Uh. Dwight.,Michael
2266,"Ah… agh… dgh… Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",Okay! Calm down.,Michael
2267,No! You calm down! Who’s side is Toby on? Who’s side are you on?,"Hey, hey!",Michael
2268,Him or me?,Stop.,Michael
2269,Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,Okay…,Michael
2270,"Either he goes, or I go.",Dwight…,Michael
2271,You choose!,Stop…,Michael
2272,One of us is out of here by the end of today!,Oh… kay…,Michael
2273,I am not bluffing!,Okay.,Michael
2274,Okay?,Yes.,Michael
2275,"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",Mm-hmm.,Michael
2276,I deserve this. You know I do!,You know your I.D. says you’re a security threat?,Michael
2277,"Oh, look, Jim. There’s a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you’re interested? I could put in a good word for you, ’cause I’ll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!","Okay… you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",Michael
2278,"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?","Maybe, I haven’t decided yet. Let’s get to work.",Michael
2279,Fine.,Good. Okay.,Michael
2280,I can’t. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.,"Well… that’s… what, a computer camera, right?",Michael
2281,You mean digital?,It’ll take like two seconds.,Michael
2282,20 bucks.,"Ugh… All right. Everybody, come on. Group photo for the newsletter.",Michael
2283,You gotta be kiddin’ me.,"Come on, everybody.",Michael
2284,"One, two, three… smile. Try to smile.","We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",Michael
2285,"Alright, I’m just gonna take it on three… whether you smile or not. One, two, three.","Good, let’s check that out. Ew, okay, all right. One more. We’ll take one more.",Michael
2286,That’ll be another 20.,What?,Michael
2287,"Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",You just press the button.,Michael
2288,I… I didn’t know that Toby was gonna write it down. I was just venting.,"Okay, good. Check that out.",Michael
2289,"You know, it was one day.",That’s terrible.,Michael
2290,"Oh, dear.","Let’s pay Mr. Price Gouger. Okay… we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.",Michael
2291,I know.,"On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.",Michael
2292,"Yeah, but… Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.",Top 80 percent!,Michael
2293,Michael?,Yeah?,Michael
2294,You know that I’m very serious here.,"Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",Michael
2295,What?,"Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we’re having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.",Michael
2296,I thought that you were their fearless leader.,"I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",Michael
2297,I think you can handle it.,"Oh, come on. Come on.",Michael
2298,"I think so, Michael…","You know, it’d be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",Michael
2299,Again? We do that every year.,"Well, they need our money. They don’t have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",Michael
2300,It’d be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.,"Well, Oscar, if you don’t like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",Michael
2301,Yes!,"So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",Michael
2302,That doesn’t exist anymore.,"Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.",Michael
2303,"No, they stopped making that show.","Well, then, they need our money more than ever.",Michael
2304,"Actually, I didn’t think it was appropriate to invite children since it’s… You know, there’s gambling and alcohol, and it’s in our dangerous warehouse and it’s a school night… And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?","Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not… that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn’t exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.",Michael
2305,I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.,"No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.",Michael
2306,Afghani.,What?,Michael
2307,Afghani.,That’s a dog.,Michael
2308,"No, that’s Afghan.",That’s a shawl.,Michael
2309,"Wait, canine AIDS?",No. Humans with AIDS.,Michael
2310,"Guys, the Afghanistananies.","Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.",Michael
2311,"Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.",It’s Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.,Michael
2312,Except my warehouse.,"Well, actually, it’s my warehouse.",Michael
2313,"Actually, it’s owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.",Why are you here?,Michael
2314,"When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.","Not. I said, not that.",Michael
2315,We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.,That’s ironic.,Michael
2316,What?,That you are afraid.,Michael
2317,Why? ‘Cause I’m from the hood?,Dinkin’ flicka.,Michael
2318,"Michael, Carol Stills for you.",Who?,Michael
2319,Carol Stills.,Do I know a Carol Stills?,Michael
2320,Your realtor.,"Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it",Michael
2321,"Hello, Michael?","Hi, Carol. How you doing?",Michael
2322,I’m great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.,"Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.",Michael
2323,"Oh, great.","Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It’s okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.",Michael
2324,"Oh, good, I’m glad. Can I drop it over later?","Actually, I’m sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.",Michael
2325,"Oh, great.","Yeah, it’ll be good. You know what? Why don’t you come by? Bring the papers, I’ll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.",Michael
2326,To the casino thing?,Yeah. It’ll be fun. What do you… What do you…,Michael
2327,What?,"Oh, I’m sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?",Michael
2328,"Michael, Jan’s on line two.","Okay, put her through. Jan Levinson, I presume?",Michael
2329,Michael?,"Hey, Jan. How you doing?",Michael
2330,"You know, I… I thought about it and you are right.",I am?,Michael
2331,"I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.","Oh, okay.",Michael
2332,"Incidentally, what is the charity?",AIDS.,Michael
2333,"Okay, then. I will see you tonight.","Okay, sounds great.",Michael
2334,Bye-bye.,"Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just…",Michael
2335,No problemo.,Right.,Michael
2336,To answer your question…,Yeah?,Michael
2337,Yes.,What?,Michael
2338,I’d love to go.,Okay.,Michael
2339,"I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn’t be a problem.",Problem. Good.,Michael
2340,"And I’ll bring the papers, too.","Good, All right. Sounds great.",Michael
2341,I’ll see you tonight.,Bye.,Michael
2342,Bye.,Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.,Michael
2343,Yeah! That’s great.,"Hey, hey.",Michael
2344,Hi.,"Hey, Carol.",Michael
2345,Hi.,You look great.,Michael
2346,Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.,"Oh, well… Kiss. That’s how we do it in the paper biz. It’s European and… Yes? Ah, Dwight",Michael
2347,Drink would be good.,Okay.,Michael
2348,Okay.,"Billy, your nurse is hot.",Michael
2349,That’s my girlfriend.,Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.,Michael
2350,She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili’s. She was my waitress.,Chili’s is great.,Michael
2351,Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?,"Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let’s get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.",Michael
2352,"Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold’em. Good luck, everybody. That’s at least four red chips to you, sir.",All-in.,Michael
2353,I’ll call.,What are… That’s insane.,Michael
2354,I have good cards.,"Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn’t that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don’t be stupid. Just take it back.",Michael
2355,"No, I’m sorry. He can’t, sir. He’s gone all-in.","Okay, all right, whatever.",Michael
2356,Flip them.,You really screwed that up.,Michael
2357,"Wow, bad luck.","Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren’t involved, I would always be winning. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",Michael
2358,Michael?,Jan.,Michael
2359,Hi.,"Look, okay, I think we’re all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.",Michael
2360,What does that mean?,"After you said you weren’t coming, I invited Carol to come and I don’t think that I did anything wrong.",Michael
2361,Okay.,Um…,Michael
2362,"Hey, hey.",Hey. What…,Michael
2363,"Come on, shooter!","Four! Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. All right, here we go!",Michael
2364,All right.,Yeah!,Michael
2365,Five.,So close. So close.,Michael
2366,Hey. I’m leaving.,"Hey, okay.",Michael
2367,"So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.",Thank you.,Michael
2368,"And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.",Okay. Thanks for coming.,Michael
2369,And you guys have a good time together.,Okay. Talk to you Monday.,Michael
2370,Goodbye.,Good night. She’s a good boss.,Michael
2371,She seems really nice.,"Oh, she’s great.",Michael
2372,Do you need anything?,No.,Michael
2373,Should I get water or donuts?,No.,Michael
2374,"What’s going on, Michael?",I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.,Michael
2375,Office Depot!,"Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun.",Michael
2376,The planet Caprica.,Where the hell is that?,Michael
2377,It’s from Battlestar Galactica.,"Okay, all right.",Michael
2378,I am going back to my desk…,"No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.",Michael
2379,Annoying.,We already have that. So…,Michael
2380,Frustrating.,"No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey’s good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.",Michael
2381,Ass.,"Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn’t so hard. All right, here we go. “Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.”",Michael
2382,"Yeah, get them, Creed!","“One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an…” Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we’re… Okay, we’re starting over.",Michael
2383,Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?,"Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.",Michael
2384,What?,Paper money. Yeah. The company’s doing fine.,Michael
2385,"Mike, we’re not shipping as much as we did last year.",Hey. Okay. You know what? Don’t even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don’t think about it.,Michael
2386,OK I think Oscar would just like if you used “lame” or something like that.,That’s what faggie means!,Michael
2387,Apparently you called Oscar “faggie” for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.,"It wasn’t just an action movie, it was Die Hard!",Michael
2388,"All right Michael, but Oscar’s really gay.",Exactly!,Michael
2389,I mean for real.,"Yeah, I know.",Michael
2390,"No, I mean he’s attracted to other men.","OK, a little too far, crossed the line.",Michael
2391,"No, it’s fine.","No. No it’s not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people “faggie” since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don’t know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I’m just… I, I can’t even imagine… the… thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me… how… you do that to another dude.",Michael
2392,Of course.,What about Oscar?,Michael
2393,Absolutely not.,"Well, he",Michael
2394,"Well, he’s not dressed in women’s clothes, so…",There could be others… I need to know. I don’t want to offend anybody else.,Michael
2395,"You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.","Yeah, I’m sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.",Michael
2396,I really don’t think so.,"I don’t know, I can imagine her with another woman, can’t you?",Michael
2397,Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.,That’s ridiculous.,Michael
2398,Yeah probably. He didn’t tell the truth a lot.,Let’s call him and get the website.,Michael

2400,"OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?",What? What does that even…,Michael
2401,"Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.","Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It’s not like gay… shame festival.",Michael
2402,"All right, now Oscar’s feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that’s your fault.",I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?,Michael

2407,Judges and juries!,"Yes, that’s a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?",Michael
2408,I’m getting married to Bob Vance.,"That’s great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing! See? Everybody has a chance!",Michael

You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can’t catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement.

2414,I would rather not.,"…and I just don’t care who sees it, doesn’t bother me!",Michael
2415,"No, NO! I don’t want to touch you, ever consider that? You’re ignorant, and insulting, and small!","All right, um… sorry.",Michael
2416,"Michael… I’m sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on.",I’m sorry I called you faggie. You’re not faggie. You’re a a good guy.,Michael
2417,"You know what, I’m going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains.

2428,Yeah?,Did you see Oprah yesterday?,Michael
2429,"No, I didn’t.","I, uh… I am going to be a father.",Michael
2430,What was Oprah about?,"Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",Michael
2431,That’s a really big decision.,I know.,Michael
2432,Maybe you should wait before you adopt.,Well…,Michael
2433,Or not adopt.,"Just do it, okay?",Michael

2445,My neighbor Alan. They’re going on a date tonight.,"Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.",Michael
2446,And your veil.,"Yeah, do it!",Michael
2447,I’ll probably just wear this.,"Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?",Michael

2632,"I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.","Okay, why don’t you throw the ball to somebody else.",Michael
2633,Nope.,"Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.",Michael
2634,I will NOT.,Okay… I’m going to toss the ball to Pam.,Michael
2635,"Let’s see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.

2636,"Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all… took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.",Do you want to talk about it anymore?,Michael
2637,"Me, me, me, me, me me. Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so…",Wait a second. That’s Weekend at Bernie’s. Do you think that this is a game?,Michael
2638,"Well, there is a ball.","All right, we’re starting over.",Michael
2639,"No, I’m done.",You are not leaving. No! We are not done.,Michael
2640,We really have a lot of work to do right now.,"Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk.",Michael
2641,"Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death’s just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going.",How do you know?,Michael
2642,What?,That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?,Michael
2643,It was obvious…,"Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn’t. You’re not a veterinarian. You don’t know ANYTHING!",Michael
2644,Michael! Michael. Michael …,"Oh, God!",Michael
2645,Oh…,"Oh my God! Oh my God, come on …",Michael
2646,Poor little fella.,Oh shhhh–oot!,Michael
2647,He is a goner.,"No, he’s not.",Michael
2648,Yeah.,"No, he’s not.",Michael
2649,"Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!","Well, you can’t get diseases from a bird!",Michael
2650,A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!,We don’t know if it’s dead.,Michael
2651,I have a lot of work to do.,"Well, I’m sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it.",Michael
2652,But…,"No, no, no! That’s enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. Find a box for him.",Michael
2653,...,"It’s okay. It’s okay. Shh… yes, I know, I know. It’s been a tough day, but it’s good to let it show.",Michael
2654,Argh… gah!,What are… What are you doing?,Michael
2655,"What? No, this is about the right size.","No, God, no it’s not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?",Michael
2656,You told us we had to.,"Dwight, do you have the box?",Michael
2657,"Actually, I have it.",You made this? Wow. That’s… that’s very nice.,Michael
2658,I’d also like to say a few words if that’s okay.,Yes.,Michael
2659,He’s not a songbird.,Shhh.,Michael
2660,Ed Truck died over the weekend.,"Oh, wow. He…",Michael
2661,"Yeah. And I know… I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.",Does his family know?,Michael
2662,"Yes, they know, Michael.",But I’m the first in the office?,Michael
2663,"I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.","Okay, yes, sure, I will do that…",Michael
2664,Good.,"…’Cause I’m the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over?",Michael
2665,…ces.,"What was that, Kevin?",Michael
2666,Nothing.,"No, you said something, didn’t you?",Michael
2667,"May he rest in pieces. You know, because there’s, like, two pieces of him.",You think that’s funny.,Michael
2668,No.,You are disgusting.,Michael
2669,"Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He’s trained as a grief counselor.","No, that can’t be right.",Michael
2670,"Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don’t think that’s what they need right now.","Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn’t it?",Michael
2671,Not really.,"You’re ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.",Michael
2672,"Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I’m always available if anyone would like to talk.","Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I’ve ever met.",Michael
2673,"Michael, I’m sorry…","No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We’re gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we’re going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?",Michael
2674,Ow! God!,"Okay, give it to me. You don’t know what you’re doing. All right.",Michael
2675,Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?,"Nothing. Let’s just… all right. Guys, do you have a box we could use?",Michael
2676,Tell me what you did yesterday.,Uhhh… nothing.,Michael
2677,Nothing?,"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",Michael
2678,I don’t care how your day was Michael.,"Wow. Well. Ok. I don’t care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",Michael
2679,Tell me what you did yesterday.,I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?,Michael
2680,Because they acted all tough and everything…,Uh huh.,Michael
2681,"But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to…","Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?",Michael
2682,I’m just saying hi to Bob.,"No, I think you’re cutting in line.",Michael

2686,Michael.,"No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I’d like to see. You read my mind.",Michael
2687,Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You’re an angel.,Michael
2688,"Hey, why don’t you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I’ll just bring you a pretzel.","Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.",Michael
2689,"You know, I just think it’s really important that you be productive today.","Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I’ll be back.",Michael
2690,Thank you!,Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.,Michael
2691,We do.,Thank God.,Michael

2695,Second?,"Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.",Michael
2696,"Account…? Michael, what is going on?",And I will be taking questions.,Michael
2697,What’s on your suit?,"Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I’m going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we’re getting a lot done, don’t you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!",Michael

2702,This is a huge sale.,Yes. Right. Good.,Michael
2703,"Night, Michael.",Goodnight!,Michael
2704,"What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.","Well, that’s really not the way I roll, because sometimes I’m in the zone, and sometimes I’m in the zoning out.",Michael
2705,Zoning out?,Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I’ll do it.,Michael
2706,If you can account for your time…,"Yes, big if.",Michael
2707,…then maybe corporate can justify your salary.,A woman spurned.,Michael

2713,Here you go.,"Nice dress, Ryan.",Michael
2714,It’s not a dress. It’s a kurta.,OK.,Michael
2715,I know.,How come you didn’t get me one?,Michael
2716,Don’t go. They eat monkey brains.,Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do… sign me up… because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.,Michael
2717,I don’t celebrate Kwanzaa.,Wha? Really? You should! It’s fun.,Michael
2718,"Um… Diwali is awesome… and there’s food… and there’s going to be dancing… and… Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um…",Kelly?,Michael

2724,I find this incredibly offensive.,"Well, I find it beautiful.",Michael
2725,"Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn’t all be subjected to it.",No…,Michael
2726,"Actually, she’s right. This isn’t appropriate. Why don’t I take these.","No, You’re not going to collect them.",Michael
2727,Yes.,"No. This is delightful, charming culture.",Michael
2728,I thought you said this was a costume party!,What does that look like to you?,Michael

I just have an announcement to make. Um… okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you’re all thinking ‘who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?’ Well, I’m not crazy. Maybe I’m crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.",Michael
2737,"Oh, Michael.",What do you say?,Michael
2738,Can we talk about this in private?,I didn’t hear you.,Michael
2739,Can we talk about this in private?,"Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me. Okay.",Michael
2740,"This is the ninth date, Michael.","Yeah, well, but I … I feel like I’ve known you many lifetimes. Maybe I’m Hindu after all. Okay, I’m not Hindu, but… Carol. Carol, I just… I feel like… I just like you so much.",Michael
2741,"I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?",Yes.,Michael

2753,You say one more word; I’m stopping the car.,Sorry.,Michael

2755,"Like, an Indian Halloween?","An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. Pam, could you put Jan on, please?",Michael
2756,"Michael, you’re on with Jan.","Hello, Jan.",Michael

2758,What is Diwali?,What is Diwali?,Michael
2759,Yes.,"You don’t know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I’m surprised. It’s the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you’d be familiar with it. It’s the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It’s like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween—",Michael

2765,"Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.",You do?,Michael
2766,"Yes, of course. It’s important to celebrate our company’s rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event—","Oh, I dunno about that.",Michael
2767,"—or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.","For Kelly, that seems a bit much.",Michael
2768,"Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric—",...,Michael
2769,She’s so wonderful.,"Yeah, you should see her naked.",Michael

2775,I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.,I don’t understand.,Michael
2776,The board voted last night to close your branch.,On whom’s authority?,Michael

2806,"So, do you know what you’re gonna say when he shows up?",I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.,Michael
2807,"No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I’ll be him, you be you. Let’s practice.",All right.,Michael
2808,Yes? What is the meaning of this?,Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?,Michael
2809,"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It’s simple dollars and cents.","Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",Michael
2810,"Listen, Scott… we’re losing money, okay? It’s not a charity; it’s a business. And it’s a dying business.","Stop… stop it! Just, okay. He’s not going to say any of that.",Michael

2858,We need to talk!,Not now.,Michael
2859,Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?,I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.,Michael

2871,You won’t be disappointed.,Let’s face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it’s not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It’s funny. It’s got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we’re all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we’re all about here in Scranton. So let’s just all laugh together and watch “Lazy Scranton”.,Michael
2872,...,"Sittin’ in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin’.",Michael

2901,...,You know what? I’ll help. I will…,Michael
2902,"No, please. No.",Don’t be shy! Dwight! Let’s do this!,Michael

2915,I have to go.,I don’t understand.,Michael
2916,I was on the fence about this and… it’s just not a good fit.,"Well, we’ll squeeze you in.",Michael
2917,No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It’s just your management style.,My management style? So… didn’t you think ‘Lazy Scranton’ was funny?,Michael
2918,No. Was it supposed to be funny?,"Okay. Well, don’t bother quitting because you’re fired.",Michael
2919,Excuse me?,"You are fired! I’m sorry, but we don’t have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!",Michael
2920,But there’s nothing in my desk except coupons.,"Don’t try to apologize to me, man! It’s too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.",Michael
2921,That was my advice. Remember? I’m the one who suggested that you fire him.,"Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.",Michael
2922,Maybe that’s because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.,"Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.",Michael
2923,Back to work. We don’t have to get along. We just have to work together.,No. We do have to get along. Can’t we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.,Michael
2924,What!,Yeah! They punk’d us! They punk’d us good! Come on. Come on!,Michael
2925,YEAH!,Yeah.,Michael
2926,I don’t… I don’t think we can do that.,"Go home, Toby. Just…",Michael
2927,Hey! Why doesn’t your car have a flat tire?,Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It’s so hateful. “You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!”,Michael
2928,For crying out loud.,"No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You’re playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don’t, oh…",Michael
2929,Got an hour? I’ll try to explain.,THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!,Michael
2930,Michael!,"Hi, Jan!",Michael
2931,Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?,I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.,Michael
2932,"Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?",Yes.,Michael
2933,You do?,But do you realize that that was actually Dwight’s idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.,Michael
2934,"What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.",What?,Michael
2935,He’s the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.,"Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.",Michael
2936,So who will be your new Number Three?,Uh… that I have not decided yet.,Michael
2937,"Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.","Thank you, Andy. That’s… very kind. Thanks.",Michael

2946,"Michael, have you met the Penguin?","Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power.",Michael
2947,"Ha, that’s why I wore this shirt.",Good.,Michael
2948,I’ll do it.,"All right. Good. Thank you. Do not look at your card. Now, I’ve always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here . So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.",Michael
2949,Very good Michael. Really good.,So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be a king of hearts.,Michael
2950,"No, no, it’s better than fantastic. It’s super perfect.","Dwight, don’t, don’t be a suck up.",Michael
2951,I want to.,"Okay Meredith, let’s give it a shot.",Michael
2952,Thank you.,"Beautiful. Very good, nice.",Michael
2953,It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.,Okay.,Michael
2954,Bull… Sorry.,We heard it.,Michael
2955,Yeah.,We heard what you said. You didn’t cover it at all.,Michael
2956,I had a tickle in my throat.,"They’re gonna have… You can’t say that, all right?",Michael
2957,I can’t say ?,Idiot. Dwight’s an idiot! Did you catch that or did… did the cough cover it?,Michael
2958,Sometimes it hurts Michael.,You’re a jerk. Dwight’s a jerk!,Michael
2959,Fantastic.,"Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.",Michael
2960,Thank youuu.,Ohh. May I?,Michael
2961,"Uh, sure!","Hey, look at me, I’m a baby! I’m one of those babies from “Look Who’s Talking.” What am I thinking? Look at all those staplers! What’s a stapler!? I don’t even know, I’m a baby!

2962,We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.,I didn’t hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. … I’m just kidding.,Michael
2963,One of the Stamford people is a criminal?,"Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.",Michael
2964,Who is it?,Hannah?,Michael
2965,Hmm. Martin?,Kuhhhh… you are such a racist.,Michael
2966,"Wait, why am I a racist?",Because you think he’s black.,Michael
2967,He is black… right? And…,Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.,Michael
2968,I wonder what he did.,"In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and… saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.",Michael
2969,Why would anyone go to jail for that?,"Sssssso, what we need to do… is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.",Michael
2970,"Sure. Let’s protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.",Good. All right.,Michael
2971,I am cool.,"Okay, are you cool, really?",Michael
2972,"I’m cool, I’m cool, I’m so cool. Tell me what is going on.","Um… Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!",Michael
2973,"Good. Getting settled, you know?","Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I… trust… him, completely, and that anybody who doesn’t is an ignorant, dumb… person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.",Michael
2974,My dad.,…Danny Glover. Yeah.,Michael
2975,Jonas Salk.,Who?,Michael
2976,Justin Timberlake?,Oh. Please. Colin Powell.,Michael

2978,Jesus.,Apollo Creed.,Michael
2979,So… you all wanna know what I was in for?,No. That’s not cool. You don’t have to tell them.,Michael
2980,"Um, I really don’t mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I… got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink.",That is awesome.,Michael
2981,"Yeah, some days I never go outside.","Well, we are running a business, so.",Michael
2982,Kinda sounds like… prison’s… better than Dunder-Mifflin.,Ah. Well. That’s not true.,Michael
2983,Prison sounds great.,No you would not.,Michael
2984,I can’t feel my toes.,Why don’t we… pump some iron? Anyone wanna… pump up?,Michael
2985,"What is that, like… five pounds?","It’s uh… two and a half. I’m not going for bulk, I’m going for tone.",Michael
2986,I’m going back inside.,"Yeah, it’s… freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you’ve got about… twenty-seven minutes of rec time.",Michael
2987,"Yeah, in the rec room.",Ah. A ten inch black and white?,Michael
2988,Do you really expect us to believe you’re somebody else?,"Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that’s just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody’s bitch. Oh, and you. You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don’t drop the soap! Don’t drop the soap!",Michael
2989,Where… did you learn all of this?,Internet.,Michael
2990,"So, not prison.","And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I’m saying. It’s not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.",Michael
2991,"What’d you do, Prison Mike?",I stole. … And I robbed. And I kidnapped… the… president’s son. And held him for ransom.,Michael
2992,"That is… quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.","And I nevah got caught, neither.",Michael
2993,Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?,"Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.",Michael
2994,Wow. Prison sounds horrible.,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.",Michael
2995,"Don’t encourage him, Dwight.","The worst thing about prison was the… was the Dementors. They… were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they’d come down, and they’d suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!",Michael
2996,Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?,"No, not Harry Potter. … There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who… have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody’s bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. ‘Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. So. What do you think? It doesn’t sound so great, does it?",Michael
2997,"Yeah, that… wasn’t really… at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I’ve seen on television. But it didn’t remind me of my time in prison.","Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.",Michael
2998,"Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.","No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it’s like to have freedom. And if this doesn’t bother them, then I am out of ideas.",Michael
2999,Michael. Why’s everyone locked in the conference room?,"They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",Michael
3000,"Well, you’re going to have to let ’em out. Or… or I will.","Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.",Michael
3001,"You know they’re teasing you. I mean… obviously, this is… a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have… we have parties here. They’re teasing you. To be funny.","Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don’t you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!",Michael
3002,"Can I help you, Michael?",I’m looking for the toy drive box.,Michael
3003,It’s behind you.,"OK… Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it’ll fit, with all these little knickknacks.",Michael
3004,Wow. What kind of bike is that?,Umm… I don’t know? Average kind?,Michael
3005,The tires look pretty worn.,"Well, that is probably from the test drive.",Michael
3006,"But the paint’s chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?",No.,Michael
3007,"Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.","Oh, thanks.",Michael
3008,Michael?,"Yes? Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn’t have to do that.",Michael
3009,"I didn’t, it’s from corporate.",OK. Did everybody get one of these?,Michael
3010,Yup.,Terrific. Good.,Michael
3011,"Hi, is Michael around here?",There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello You’re about five hours early to the party. You’re such a blonde.,Michael
3012,Michael.,"Hey, everybody. I don’t know who you haven’t met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend – Carol. This is just the front of her. Show ’em, show ’em the other side.",Michael
3013,What?,"Turn around, turn around. Come on.",Michael
3014,Get outta here.,"No, you get outta here.",Michael

3019,"No. See, we never went on a ski trip.",I know.,Michael
3020,I went on a ski trip.,Right.,Michael
3021,Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.,"Yes, but what you didn’t realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart…",Michael
3022,Michael.,And next to your kids. What?,Michael
3023,This is so weird.,I don’t understand?,Michael
3024,I think you’re a really sweet guy.,OK,Michael
3025,"But, um, I don’t know how to deal with, with this thing . And, and the proposal. And I don’t think things are going to work out with us.","No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you’re not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in Jamaica’s largest fresh water pool.",Michael
3026,What are you talking about?,"I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.",Michael
3027,"Oh, no. Michael.",And it’s all inclusive.,Michael

3029,I’m sorry.,"No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.",Michael
3030,You can’t cancel a holiday.,Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year’s.,Michael
3031,What does that mean?,"Jim, take New Year’s away from Stanley.",Michael
3032,"Michael, what’s going on?",Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don’t think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.,Michael
3033,Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?,Fine! Have your party. Just no guests.,Michael
3034,But we invited guests.,"Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.",Michael
3035,I know.,It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.,Michael
3036,"OK, well, why are you laying like that?",Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?,Michael
3037,Like what?,"Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?",Michael
3038,"Well.. um I, I don’t…",And not that you didn’t want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I’m referring to?,Michael
3039,"Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we’re one bathrobe short.",Take it from Toby.,Michael
3040,Copy.,"Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?",Michael

3042,"Hey, what’s the haps?",Carol?,Michael
3043,Why don’t you just buy the whole song?,I don’t have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just… I just want a little taste of it.,Michael
3044,"Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars ’cause they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn’t that affect the final… How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.",Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.,Michael

3094,Hey. You have a bunch of messages and… that’s nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.",Michael

3106,"We couldn’t do it without you, so we postponed.",I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.,Michael
3107,By the end of the day? That’s impossible.,The Jamaicans don’t have a word for “impossible.”,Michael
3108,"Oh yeah, oh my God.","No, no, no. No, that’s a German woman named Urkel Grue.",Michael
3109,Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.,"Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.",Michael
3110,You took the ice queen? I don’t buy it.,"Well I’m looking at a photo, right now. And I’m telling ‘ya, could be in Maxim.",Michael
3111,They wouldn’t give you a subscription to Maxim.,Oh no?,Michael
3112,No.,"OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?",Michael
3113,"Well, no. I got nothing.",Check it again. Hit refresh.,Michael
3114,"Yeah, Mike, still nothing.","OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at…",Michael
3115,He’s in the office.,"OK, Hey, man, how’s it going?",Michael
3116,"All right, what’s up Mike?","That’s great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?",Michael
3117,Yup.,"OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not “packaging.” Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?",Michael
3118,Uh huh.,"OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.",Michael
3119,Yup.,And you sent that out to everyone?,Michael
3120,Who’s the target?,"A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is “Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.”",Michael
3121,What’s it of?,Not important.,Michael
3122,"Unless you’re willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.","OK, forget it.",Michael
3123,Hey I need to talk to you right now.,"Not now, not ever.",Michael
3124,About you and Jan.,"Aww, none of your business.",Michael
3125,"Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you’ve entered into an intimate relationship.","That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.",Michael
3126,"Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife… we don’t talk now.",This is probably the icebreaker you need.,Michael
3127,"You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.","I bet you would love all the details, wouldn’t you? Skeevy little perv.",Michael
3128,"All right, if you’re having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.","No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?",Michael
3129,"All right, thanks Michael.",OK.,Michael
3130,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it’s Jan on the phone for you.","Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I’m not here. Tell… tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.",Michael

3135,Jan.,"No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe…",Michael
3136,Urkel Grue.,"My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let’s be professional, all right?",Michael
3137,Hey.,Hey.,Michael
3138,What are you doing out here?,Island living. You know?,Michael
3139,Jan called. She’s coming in later to talk to you.,Did she say what it’s about?,Michael
3140,I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.,There are copies in the bathroom?,Michael
3141,There were. A lot of them.,All right.,Michael
3142,Hello everyone. Hello Michael.,Guh.,Michael
3143,"Very sunny. Family’s important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.","OK, yup.",Michael
3144,"Why am I here, Michael?",I…,Michael
3145,"In the last year, I’ve gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not… communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?",I… I… Yes.,Michael
3146,"I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means… lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.","OK, yeah.",Michael
3147,"This is the kind of thing, you know? I am… attracted to you. I, I don’t know why, I… but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that’s what Dr. Perry thinks.",Who is Dr. Perry? I…,Michael
3148,"This is the point, OK? You’re wrong for me. In… In… every way. But I still find myself wanting to… be with you.","And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.",Michael
3149,"Good, good.","So, umm… thanks for coming by. So, I, uh…",Michael
3150,"Well, good, OK. Thank you… for taking the time…","Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate –",Michael
3151,"Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.","Jan, you… complete… me.",Michael
3152,"Hello, you’re back.","Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.",Michael
3153,While you were gone…,Me had an i-rey time.,Michael
3154,"While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.","Dwight, please, please.",Michael
3155,He turned over my…,"I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let’s don’t… Don’t harsh my mellow, mon.",Michael
3156,Unbelievable.,"Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.",Michael

3162,Thank you.,"Stanley, I got you some ganja. I’m just kidding. It’s coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.",Michael
3163,"But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that’s fun.","His name is Bavon. And you know what? I’m sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I’m sure he would like to take a day off. I’m sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.",Michael
3164,Are you stoned?,I…,Michael
3165,"In the picture, are you high?","Oh, that’s red eye.",Michael
3166,You look like you have the munchies.,Well…,Michael
3167,I have the munchies. I’m gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.,"Hey, can we just focus?",Michael
3168,Come on. Come on.,"Okay. Well, Jan’s email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.",Michael
3169,Try Dwight.,"Her passwords aren’t going to be Dwight, Dwight. That’s stupid. Okay.",Michael
3170,There is a butterfly on this. Why?,It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don’t remember in which direction.,Michael
3171,"So it’s either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.","Yes, good luck with that.",Michael
3172,"I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks.","Sorry, oh wow, that’s so rude. I’m sorry, I can’t control him.",Michael

3178,"Hmmm, well… let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don’t know. Michael Scott.",Oh.,Michael
3179,Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.,"Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.",Michael
3180,"Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.","Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.",Michael
3181,"Oh, uh, thanks.","Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.",Michael
3182,Pass.,You can’t pass. You’ve got to pick somebody.,Michael
3183,Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a… motor… carriage.,Dwight?,Michael
3184,Yup?,Here ya go.,Michael
3185,Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?,Please.,Michael
3186,He does your laundry?,"Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the “Amazing Race.” And you guys are the retired marines. And you guys are the mother and daughter. And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?",Michael
3187,"Wait, “Amazing Race” like, the biggest sale wins?","No, we’re just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.",Michael
3188,Is there a prize?,Just bragging rights.,Michael
3189,Then how is this “Amazing Race”?,"It’s just… brrrrrr… It’s “Amazing Race,” Phyllis. Okay? We’re in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let’s do it.",Michael
3190,Michael.,"Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!",Michael
3191,What’s the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?,"Ugh… that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.",Michael
3192,"I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It’s really a pleasure to be a part of it. It’s like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?",Hawkman.,Michael
3193,My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don’t give up easily. I have walked two marathons.,Let’s go. The men’s room was disgusting.,Michael
3194,Yep.,"You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.",Michael
3195,Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It’s in the Hamptons. My dad’s got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow’s nest. Also shot a deer once.,"You know what? Let’s get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.",Michael
3196,"Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We’ve had some problems in the past.","I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.",Michael
3197,"Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.",No.,Michael
3198,"I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.",Stop it. Stop it.,Michael
3199,Oh man. Talk about your classic “Lame dash O.” Do we even want that guy buying our paper?,Yes.,Michael
3200,I… I’m so sorry man. I really screwed that up.,"Ah, no. Don’t worry about it.",Michael
3201,I really ‘Schruted’ it.,What?,Michael
3202,"‘Schruted’ it. It’s just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you ‘Schruted’ it. I don’t know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",I don’t know. Who knows how words are formed.,Michael
3203,Hey boss. Got a minute?,"Yes, Andy.",Michael
3204,"I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?",He didn’t say.,Michael
3205,"That’s weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That’s not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?","No, you are remembering it wrong.",Michael
3206,"Dwight’s name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don’t know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote “Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.”",I knew it.,Michael
3207,"Hey, we nailed the sale!",Where were you this morning?,Michael
3208,I overslept. Damn rooster didn’t crow.,"Why do you lie, liar?",Michael
3209,I am not a liar.,You are lying right now.,Michael
3210,"Stay out of this, you!","I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.",Michael
3211,"Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.","Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.",Michael
3212,That’s what she said.,Don’t. Don’t you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.,Michael
3213,I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.,Good luck.,Michael
3214,The cost of doing business.,"Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman…",Michael
3215,Was the top salesman…,I said ‘was’.,Michael
3216,Addition by subtraction.,What does that even mean? That is impossible.,Michael
3217,Mmmm. Yeah you’re right.,"But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody’s spirits.",Michael
3218,"Hey, boss.","Hey, what’s up.",Michael
3219,Noooothin’. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?,Yep.,Michael
3220,"Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my “Lost” on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?",I don’t know. Maybe.,Michael
3221,"Well, I will take that as a maybe. Where are you going?",Bathroom.,Michael
3222,Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?,Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.,Michael
3223,"Oh, that wasn’t the night crew. That was Dwight.",Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.,Michael
3224,"Feel ya, dawg.","Yeah, do you?",Michael
3225,Absolutely.,What did I say?,Michael
3226,You said…,Huh.,Michael
3227,"Which is like, “Right on.” And Pam was like “blah blah blah” and you were like “Yeah, psht.” Nailed it.","Oh, no.",Michael
3228,I really have no preference. We don’t even have to have a party.,"No, hey, hey. Don’t be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.",Michael
3229,Michael —,"No, no, no. I mean, not because you’re gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar’s Mexicanity. So Phyllis… I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.",Michael
3230,Why don’t you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.,"Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let’s get him one.",Michael
3231,Sort of. He had a lot of clients.,"Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?",Michael
3232,"Oh, sure, we talk all the time.",Really?,Michael
3233,No.,"Don’t – don’t do that. That’s not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.",Michael
3234,"I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.",Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.,Michael
3235,Yes.,Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?,Michael
3236,Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?,Um.,Michael
3237,"Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football – Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we’ll hit the tiz-own.",No. I don’t want to do any of that.,Michael
3238,Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.,"No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You’re going to drive me crazy.",Michael
3239,"Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It’s your funeral. See how that works out for you.",Hey.,Michael
3240,Hey.,What’s up?,Michael
3241,Same old.,Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.,Michael
3242,"Oh my God, she told you?","Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",Michael
3243,Accepted.,How’s this place treating you?,Michael
3244,The boss isn’t funny.,"Oh, well.",Michael
3245,I don’t get to wear my ties.,No. I’m sure.,Michael
3246,So?,"So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.",Michael
3247,I don’t want to do your laundry anymore.,We can talk about that. All right.,Michael
3248,"Actually, yeah. I didn’t think I would, but turns out — it’s great.",Ladies and gentlemen! May I present… Mr. Dwight Schrute!,Michael
3249,Thank you.,"Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You’re gonna break it. Not bad, huh?",Michael
3250,You did this for me?,Guilty.,Michael
3251,It reminds me a lot of the ‘Three Amigos’ with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.,"Wow. Thank you. Wow, that’s– thanks so much.",Michael
3252,How do you know it’s going to be a boy?,"How, would you stop interrupting please?",Michael
3253,What?,We will demonstrate on Pam.,Michael
3254,No. No.,Come on.,Michael
3255,Ow.,Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.,Michael
3256,What if he’s a murderer?,He’s not going to be a murderer.,Michael
3257,Maybe that’s how you die.,"You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?",Michael
3258,I want to do this.,Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-,Michael
3259,Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only.,"No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy’s night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it’s more of a guy’s afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it’s uh, not gay, it’s just a, it’s a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys.",Michael
3260,Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!,Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh!,Michael
3261,What happened?,Oh God-,Michael
3262,Quick somebody help! Help the man!,"No, no, no!",Michael
3263,I have a full day of sales calls.,You should get out of them.,Michael
3264,...,"It’s the only time he can do it. 2:30 to 3:15. It’s going to be great. We’re going to be doing some darts, we’re going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie. Going to be very delicious.",Michael
3265,And what kind of stripper did you get?,I did not order a stripper.,Michael
3266,You didn’t order a stripper? Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?,"Um, not personally, no.",Michael
3267,"Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101. If you don’t get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard.",I can’t get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment.,Michael
3268,"Just get one for the girls too. That evens it out. You know, separate but equal.",So that’s what that means.,Michael
3269,Alright! Uh!,Gay.,Michael
3270,What?,Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies.,Michael
3271,I’m on it.,Well get on it. And make it happen.,Michael
3272,He hasn’t even said a word yet. Just giggling.,"Gotcha, oh! Yes?",Michael
3273,Are you okay?,"I’m in the, I’m in the sex shop.",Michael
3274,"Ah, gotcha. Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.",Squarepants?,Michael
3275,"Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.",And you think that’d be sexy?,Michael
3276,Hold the door please!,Oh.,Michael
3277,Thank you.,Oh. Hello!,Michael
3278,Hello!,You wearing a thong?,Michael
3279,...,"Hello ladies. Who here is a history buff? Who’s a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.",Michael
3280,"Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin.","Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?",Michael
3281,"Knickers in fact, yes!","He’s in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.",Michael
3282,"Well, actually, I never was president.","Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.",Michael
3283,Ah. I’m here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers.,And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow.,Michael
3284,"Wait, this is the entertainment?","Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one.",Michael
3285,Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?,No. Yes.,Michael
3286,Oh gross.,But I got all the foot off of it.,Michael
3287,"Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.","Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity.",Michael
3288,"Okay. The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.",I call shuffle. Here we go.,Michael
3289,Michael.,"Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I’d like to introduce you to Elizabeth.",Michael
3290,Hi guys!,Nice outfit.,Michael
3291,Hit it. So where’s the groom?,He’s right there. There he is.,Michael

3293,Just sit on down.,Alright.,Michael
3294,Alright.,Okay.,Michael
3295,Here we go.,Here we go. Alright!,Michael
3296,Yeah!,Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide.,Michael
3297,"Mmm, what’s that?",You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so…,Michael
3298,I bet she’d be jealous.,"Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I’m sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!",Michael
3299,"You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son.",Really.,Michael
3300,But I kept all this from my wife Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler sex.,"Well, Ben Franklin, you’re really kind of a sleezebag.",Michael
3301,"Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone.",Wow. Thank you.,Michael
3302,"Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you, are you okay?","Not really, look I don’t know how to say this so I just will.",Michael
3303,Okay.,I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.,Michael
3304,"Uh when, when did, when last night?","No, today at work.",Michael
3305,You went to a bachelor party at work?,Yes. I kind of arranged it.,Michael
3306,I’m closer to firing you.,That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that?,Michael
3307,I’ll talk to you later.,You are. You are.,Michael
3308,"Thanks, Michael. That’s sweet. Same as when you said it outside.",How you doin’? You excited.,Michael
3309,"Yes, very.","Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?",Michael
3310,No.,"You’re probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It’s okay, if you did. It’s a very natural reaction. It’s your wedding. And you’re nervous…",Michael
3311,That wasn’t me.,Okay… umm… I’m sure that Bob… Wow. That is… that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah… Are you set on that hairstyle?,Michael
3312,I thought it was…,"Here, let me…",Michael
3313,Michael… No.,Just cover up that bald patch.,Michael
3314,"I don’t need your… thank you. No, Michael please… I just need some time alone.",Okay.,Michael
3315,You might be surprised to learn that I’ve only been to one other wedding. It’s actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.,I hate you!,Michael
3316,I hate you!,Long story short: Jeff’s dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said ‘boo’.,Michael
3317,That’s my dress.,That’s ok.,Michael
3318,...,This is bull****!,Michael
3319,I do.,"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!",Michael
3320,"And do you, Bob…","Oh, shiii…",Michael
3321,You may now kiss the bride.,"Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. Yeah! That’s what I’m talking about!",Michael

Hi, I’m Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I’m going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster’s Dictionary defines “wedding” as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch.

3334,Phyllis and you will be great together.,We are great together. We are a great team.,Michael
3335,The Celtics were a great team.,Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don’t want this to ruin her honeymoon.,Michael

3348,"…Dunder-Mifflin can’t compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off…","I can’t hear what he’s saying, but he looks like he’s really into it.",Michael
3349,"And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.","Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone’s textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have… a book… that is worth its weight in gold. I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you’re inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.",Michael
3350,Michael.,…And products!,Michael
3351,What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.,"Well… okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.",Michael
3352,"Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?","We can’t overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.",Michael

3358,But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?,David will always beat Goliath.,Michael
3359,"But there’s five Goliaths, there’s… Staples, Officemax…","Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators… mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we’re learning in business school?",Michael
3360,But in the big picture…,"Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can’t you understand that? No, you can’t. You’re too young. Ryan… has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he’s a tease. Well you know what? He doesn’t know anything, and neither do you. SO SUCK ON THAT!",Michael
3361,…It wasn’t personal.,"Business is always personal. It’s the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.",Michael
3362,Pack my–?,"You heard me, pack your things.",Michael
3363,"Look, I’m sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and… of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don’t have to fire me.","Fire you? No, no no. You are moving… to the annex.",Michael

3383,How have you adopted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?,"Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise…ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on… rocks? Any one else? Yep.",Michael
3384,Just following up on that first question…,"No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.",Michael
3385,OK.,OK.,Michael
3386,New question.,Very good.,Michael
3387,In the digital age…,OK.,Michael
3388,… email…,Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time… Yes.,Michael

3420,"Wonderful, let’s, ah, see where we can put this. Ok.","Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.",Michael
3421,"I’m sure that it’s catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It’s a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.",Awesome. I’m going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.,Michael
3422,You realize this is a legal document that says you can’t sue the company.,Over our love.,Michael
3423,I’ve never told you that I love you.,"You don’t have to, Jan. This contract says it all.",Michael

3428,"So did the merger go smoothly, or?","It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.",Michael
3429,I’m the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.,"Yeah, but you’re great now, right? We’re all great. Aren’t we great?",Michael
3430,"Can I get anyone anything, or?",I could go for an appeteaser.,Michael
3431,Martini please.,Bagel bites or something.,Michael
3432,Does that include the garage?,"Dwight, wow. That’s not appropriate.",Michael
3433,It’s a common question.,"David, how much did this house cost?",Michael
3434,"This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.","Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean.",Michael

3437,It’s nice.,You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.,Michael
3438,"I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.","Oh yeah, they don’t allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis… there. But it’s fun. It’s an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.",Michael
3439,Oh.,Crazy.,Michael

3447,"Slam me up against the wall, right here.",I’m not going to slam you up against the wall.,Michael
3448,"Oh, please.",You’re acting inappropriate. Jan.,Michael
3449,I feel sick.,You didn’t have any of the potato salad did you?,Michael
3450,"No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.","Well, if that’s the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.",Michael
3451,Please don’t cry.,I’m not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don’t you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.,Michael
3452,"It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.","I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.",Michael
3453,I didn’t mean it. I was…,Whatever.,Michael
3454,"Tired. I’m tired. And I didn’t eat enough. And, and, that’s all. That was it.","That’s all, you didn’t mean it?",Michael
3455,That’s all. I didn’t mean it. That’s all. I’m just saying I didn’t mean it.,"I love you, Jan.",Michael
3456,"Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!","It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.",Michael
3457,Is Toby there?,No…,Michael
3458,"Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his…","No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he’s just using this Roy thing as leverage.",Michael

3460,What did I tell you about “yeppers?”,I don’t… remember.,Michael
3461,I told you not to say it. Do you remember that?,Yeesh…,Michael
3462,Where’d you get that?,Wikipedia.,Michael
3463,"Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I’ve been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.","Hmm, well that’s interesting Darryl. I think… that maybe you should…",Michael
3464,I can’t hear you.,"What I’m saying is that,",Michael
3465,Still nothin’.,"Ok, see what I did?",Michael
3466,No.,"By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.",Michael

3476,Cool.,"You know what? Actually, let’s go into the conference room.",Michael
3477,Okay.,"No, you know what? Let’s stay here. No let’s go… Yeah let’s go to the conference room.",Michael
3478,"Okay, I’ll start. It’s pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I’m scheduled to get one in six months, but I’d like that to be moved up to now.","Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don’t think corporate is going to go for this right now.",Michael
3479,Are you wearin’ lady clothes?,What?,Michael
3480,Are you wearin’ lady clothes? Those look like lady… pants.,"No, this is a power suit.",Michael
3481,That there’s a woman’s suit.,I do not buy woman’s clothes. I would not make that mistake again.,Michael
3482,"I’ma call Roy, man.",Ohh… kay.,Michael
3483,This is gonna make him feel better.,All right.,Michael
3484,This is too good.,"Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman’s suit?",Michael

3491,...,Italians don’t wear pockets.,Michael

3493,"Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.","Um, let’s just do this in 15 minutes.",Michael
3494,"Well, it’s simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we’re shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I’m pickin’ up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin’ a raise.",...,Michael
3495,What? I can’t hear you.,That was a very good point.,Michael
3496,"I can’t— what, Mike? Are you—",You make a very compelling argument.,Michael
3497,Why can’t I just… tell you?,"Because, that is the way these things are done. In… films. No, slide— slide it, yes.",Michael
3498,There you go.,Oh. Come on. Be serious.,Michael

3552,"Her. Yes, “her” is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay?","Ah, fine.",Michael
3553,Do you understand that?,Yeeesh.,Michael
3554,How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?,Bail’er? I hardly know her.,Michael
3555,"These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,","Yes, yes. But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world… if somebody…",Michael
3556,What the,It’s a big red trash compactor!,Michael
3557,Don’t disrespect the baler!,"Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. … Only on the rarest of occasions…",Michael
3558,No do not touch it!,…would I go near—,Michael
3559,"Ok, um, one thing that you’re gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you’re gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.","Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and…",Michael
3560,"Um, yeah. You’re computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it’s also recommended that you step away for about… about ten minutes every hour.","Wow, that is… that time really adds up. That’s like… a half an hour, every hour?",Michael
3561,Take them at the same time.,"Ok, you know what? You’re making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?",Michael
3562,"You know, anything that warms you.","Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. Sorry, he is very lame. Um, let’s see. “Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.”",Michael
3563,"Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain’t it?","Ok guys, you know what? I didn’t— I didn’t interrupt when you were having your presentation.",Michael
3564,"Actually, you did.","Yes. Okay, let’s do another one. This is a good one. “A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute—“",Michael
3565,Sedentary.,Yes. “Which can contribute to heart disease.” Heart disease kills more people that balers.,Michael
3566,"That’s called having a fat butt, Michael.","Mmmm, no, no, it’s… sedentary…",Michael
3567,"Yeah, yeah. That’s, that’s fat butt disease. That’s what you suffer from?",No.,Michael
3568,"Alright, we outta here.","Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I—",Michael
3569,"That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you, Mike. It’s serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin’ on your biscuit. Never havin’ to risk it.","Okay. … What, Nerf isn’t cool anymore?",Michael
3570,I don’t understand the question.,Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.,Michael
3571,Yeah…,"I— I— Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin’ fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that…",Michael
3572,It’s really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.,"Yeah… you are… ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don’t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight… and you know science.",Michael
3573,"So, you’re okay?",Indubitably.,Michael

3581,...,BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh… crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.,Michael

3583,Got it.,"Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.",Michael
3584,We’re not allowed to use the baler.,"Have Pa–adge do it, or… the sea monster.",Michael

3586,"When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.",I don’t know if I wanna do this.,Michael
3587,Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!,"No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we’re not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.",Michael

3598,Don’t do anything rash!,"Wait, where are the warehouse guys?",Michael

3605,"Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.","And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!",Michael
3606,"No, there’s nothing to see over there, people! There’s nothing to see. …They found the castle, Michael.",Damn it.,Michael
3607,"Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.",What is it?,Michael
3608,Come down and… open it and you’ll see.,"Dwight, find out what the present is.",Michael
3609,"Oh… It’s uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they’re only available in Japan.","Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it?",Michael

3612,"A lot… of things. Uh, you, uh… What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It’s goin’ good, right?","It’s complicated with Jan. And I don’t know where I stand, or what I want. The sex isn’t nearly as good as it used to be.",Michael
3613,"Mike, you’re a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just to",Do you really mean that?,Michael
3614,I couldn’t do it. I— I ain’t that strong. And I ain’t that brave.,I’m braver than you?,Michael
3615,...,I Braveheart. I am.,Michael
3616,"Come down, okay?","Okay. Pam, I’m coming down to get my present.",Michael
3617,I thought I’d stay and answer the phones.,"Don’t worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life… Your long lovely life. saved it.",Michael
3618,Come on.,Field Trip.,Michael
3619,Step lively. Single file everybody.,Like we’re going to the science museum.,Michael
3620,Let’s single…,Learn by touching.,Michael
3621,Single… OK.,I’ve been told that I’m a tactile learner.,Michael

3637,One more. Why are you talking like that?,"To save time, Jim.",Michael
3638,"Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.",You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?,Michael
3639,Here.,"Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.",Michael
3640,That’s really not our job.,...,Michael
3641,"Yeah, I gotta call out on that.","No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person.",Michael

3647,You look good in this.,"So, let us consider this matter ended.",Michael
3648,Well it isn’t ended. I’m… I’m very angry. I— I could have lost business.,"I know, I know you’re angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.",Michael
3649,I don’t accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying.,"Well, we are extremely sorry.",Michael
3650,"Well, it— it doesn’t help, because it already happened to me.",The watermark… it’s a one time thing.,Michael
3651,May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.,OK…,Michael
3652,"I, for starters, I think that you should resign.","Well… OK, well… Um, wasn’t really my fault. The guys at the papermill—",Michael
3653,You’re the head—,The guys at the papermill— No no no!,Michael
3654,You’re the head of the company!,...,Michael
3655,"Yes, and that makes it your responsibility—","No, I’m a regional manager—",Michael
3656,And so you should lose your job!,"No— my— OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!",Michael

3659,I’m calling the Better Business Bureau.,"Yeah, well I’m calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! Did you get all that?",Michael
3660,It’s just the Scranton Times…,"No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then… YouTube gets a hold of it…",Michael
3661,You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.,You’re right. It will blow over. But it’s not… going to take… a week or two. Do you know what this is for?,Michael
3662,"Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.",That’s how devoted I am to this job.,Michael
3663,I’m just saying…,I know.,Michael
3664,They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.,"I understand that, Dwight.",Michael
3665,"You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.","Do you think you’re taking it a little… literally, Dwight? And now we’re wasting tape. I’m gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?",Michael

3668,Cut.,"OK, ready?",Michael
3669,One day for what?,That’s… they always give an ultimatum.,Michael

3672,"No, we’re not.",I’m sorry.,Michael
3673,Say you’re sorry times infinity…,Okay.,Michael

3681,"Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.","OK. Phyllis, you say? Hmm.",Michael
3682,What is so funny?,"Um… I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh… Karen from behind?",Michael
3683,I’m guessing not.,I’m sorry. It’s pretty funny when you think about it.,Michael
3684,It’s disgusting and demeaning.,"Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? OK. He’s back! OK. Hmm. Waagh!",Michael
3685,"Hey, what’s going on? There’s a police car in the…",What? Oh.,Michael
3686,What’s going on?,"Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It’s, uh…",Michael
3687,I don’t think laughing about it is an appropriate response.,"Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she’s not even here, so no harm, no foul.",Michael
3688,I don’t think the women in this office –,"Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you’re the flasher.",Michael
3689,I was at a parent-teacher conference.,"Uh-huh. Prove it. Let’s see your penis. I… you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.",Michael
3690,"Michael, …",Huh?,Michael
3691,"…come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.",I don’t know. I feel… I drive a lot. I’m spending a fortune on gas and tolls –,Michael
3692,"I’ll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I’ll leave it on the dresser.","Um, that… I don’t know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.",Michael
3693,$300?,"I… uh, well, I don’t know.",Michael
3694,Agreed. Let me show you what I’ve been working on.,OK.,Michael
3695,"There are several penises there I’d love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.",This is the last,Michael
3696,Look at that one.,"Dwight, are those your pants? That’s a Polaroid.",Michael
3697,"“Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.” Nobody dress like that.","OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don’t you just take these women, put ’em in a burlap sack, and hit ’em with a stick? Because that’s what you’re doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.",Michael
3698,"Look, it’s really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.","See? That’s what we’re talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?",Michael
3699,"Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?","No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That’s it. Conference room, five minutes. Women’s appreciation.",Michael
3700,"Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?","Oh, I don’t know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?",Michael
3701,"Mm, less than three.",That is not current.,Michael
3702,Those are collectible action figures and they’re worth more than your car.,You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.,Michael
3703,"Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?","Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.",Michael
3704,What a surprise.,"OK, no catfights. Please. Let’s – my point is… my point is… a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.",Michael
3705,...,"What are…? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women’s problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. Even the hot ones aren’t really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn’t care. Society sucks. I don’t even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.",Michael
3706,What you’re saying is extremely misogynistic.,"Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.",Michael
3707,I’m saying that you’re being sexist.,No. I’m being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.,Michael
3708,Michael.,Yes.,Michael
3709,"When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.",Because wha… that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.,Michael
3710,"And when we get mad, you always ask us if we’re on our periods.",I have to know whether you’re serious or not.,Michael
3711,Can we just get back to work?,"Ye – OK, yes.",Michael
3712,This is not work talk.,"You’re right. You’re right, you’re right. And you know why? It’s because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we’re gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.",Michael
3713,It’s a little too tight. I’m gonna find another spot.,Many women,Michael
3714,"Thank you, Michael.","You’re welcome. You’re welcome, you’re welcome. OK. So, let’s dish.",Michael
3715,What do you want to dish about?,Anything you guys want. This is your time. Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it “shmear?” Like the cream cheese.,Michael
3716,"Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.","What, um… what do you think of role-play?",Michael
3717,"Oh, it can be fun.","Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.",Michael
3718,It’s a pretty common one.,I just… I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.,Michael
3719,"Michael, you shouldn’t do anything that you’re uncomfortable with.",Jan says anything that doesn’t scare us is not worth doing. I don’t know. Maybe we’re different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.,Michael
3720,"Oh, my God.",And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.,Michael
3721,That is not healthy behavior.,"No, it’s not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.",Michael
3722,"Michael, you need to get out of this.","No, she’s… she’s fooling around. It’s a woman thing.",Michael
3723,"No, normal women don’t do stuff like that. This is bad.","No… No, it’s all right. I’m OK. I’m OK. You guys… what are we gonna do about Jan?",Michael
3724,Read the pros first.,"OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.",Michael
3725,"OK, OK. Um, cons.",Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I’m unhappy when I’m with her. Flat-chested.,Michael
3726,What was the last one?,She’s totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.,Michael
3727,"No, the one before that.",I’m unhappy when I’m with her.,Michael
3728,Michael… you shouldn’t be with someone who doesn’t make you happy.,I’m happy sometimes. Um… when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.,Michael
3729,"Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.","Yeah, that’s smart.",Michael
3730,Maybe. But it sounds like you’re just wrong for each other.,That sounds good too. I don’t know who’s right. I just don’t – I don’t know. I don’t know.,Michael
3731,"I bet you know. Don’t think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?",I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.,Michael
3732,No one said it has no calories.,"Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. Come on. Get in here.",Michael
3733,Slower. Slower. Meredith. Slow it up.,"Oh. Oh, no. It’s Jan. What do I do?",Michael
3734,Don’t answer it.,"OK, it stopped.",Michael
3735,"Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?","Uh, yeah. Yep. Um… Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will…",Michael
3736,"Here, uh… Meredith? Why don’t you put your hazards on.","Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let’s see. There we go! Good. Yes, we have the… all right.",Michael
3737,I think I’ve got it.,Do you have a… a crescent? A crescent Allan?,Michael

3739,"Good luck, Michael.","You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let’s do this. Let’s do it.",Michael
3740,"OK, remember, be strong.",I love you guys. Now I’m getting her voicemail.,Michael
3741,Don’t leave a –,"Hey, Jan. It’s me, Michael. I’m just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it’s not me, it’s you. OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I’ll talk to you later.",Michael
3742,"Michael… I was, um… I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I… I just – I couldn’t stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So… I’m sorry.",Thank you.,Michael

3747,So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?,Love it.,Michael
3748,"Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?","Uh, yes, I am.",Michael
3749,"Good, good, it’s the best business reporting isn’t it?","Uh, yeah, it’s okay. Its just, I don’t think the cartoons are very funny.",Michael
3750,"Wait, wait, what cartoons?","The a cartoon that goes with each article. This one says Mel Karmazin? I don’t, I don’t know. I guess I get it.",Michael
3751,...,We should really start recycling.,Michael
3752,"OK, where does it hurt?",Just… all over. I don’t want to do anything… I’m dying…,Michael

3772,I thought we were just having fun at the beach.,"We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people’s character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.",Michael
3773,You want me to write down people’s indefinable qualities?,"I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?",Michael
3774,"Oh, sweet mother of God.","If you don’t like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.",Michael
3775,Excuse me?,"Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!",Michael
3776,Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn’t just a trip to the beach.,"Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm’s turning people off.",Michael
3777,I hope there will be management parables.,"Well, Hey Pam, did you get that down?",Michael
3778,Like what?,Like everything I said and everything they did and… Just don’t…,Michael
3779,"Well… no, I don’t… exactly… what?",Well write it down before you forget it. That’s… You’ve just been drawing pictures. Rrrr. I can’t stay mad at you.,Michael
3780,Everyone put on sunscreen.,"Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. OK, everybody up! Circle ’round. Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America’s eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.",Michael
3781,What?,"Just words. Inspiring words. Not a contender. For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.",Michael
3782,Yes!,Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.,Michael
3783,I choose Michael!,I’m not playing.,Michael
3784,"OK, seriously. You really shouldn’t be saying that.","Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok… Stanley, your team name?",Michael
3785,I don’t care what you call my team.,Then I will name your team the Red team.,Michael
3786,We will be team U.S.A.,"Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.",Michael
3787,"There’s already a twist, you’re carrying an egg on a spoon.","Shh… The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds.

3788,"There’s nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh… diligent note-taking.",Pam…you’re missing things.,Michael
3789,Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?,"Smart as a whip! Yes! These are pre-cooked, so it’s not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I’m going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.",Michael
3790,When’s the contest?,Like umm… ten minutes?,Michael
3791,How am I supposed to… get…,Thanks a bunch.,Michael
3792,Can I have a turkey burger?,"No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?",Michael

3795,"No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it’ll slide down your gullet more easily.","Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.",Michael
3796,What is it?,I can’t say.,Michael
3797,"You can’t say, or you can’t pronounce it?","The winner gets a regional manager’s salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.",Michael
3798,Can we just take those first two things?,The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I’m interviewing for a job at corporate. And they’re only interviewing a handful of people and I’m the most qualified and I’ll probably get it. Alright?,Michael
3799,You’re leaving?,I didn’t want to tell anyway. I didn’t want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don’t know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.,Michael
3800,Do you expect me to believe that you’re truly making your recommendations on this basis?,Word. There we go. Let’s see it.,Michael
3801,One came up.,"13 hot dogs, everybody!",Michael
3802,"Uh, we don’t have any safety mittens",Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It’s alright. It’s alright. Here we go.,Michael
3803,Get ’em big boy!,"Aaaaaand, go!",Michael
3804,What are you doing?,"Nice, Stanley!",Michael
3805,Gaaaaa….,One. Two. Three.,Michael
3806,Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!,Excellent!,Michael
3807,"I think they’re even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don’t really know how to compare those units.",Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.,Michael
3808,"I really doubt it, Michael.",Please just check.,Michael
3809,"How so? I mean… sure thing, that sounds smart… I can’t do this anymore! I’m goin’ to sit in the bus.","Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!",Michael
3810,"I’m gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That’s the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?","No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.",Michael
3811,I’d like to try it.,Pointless.,Michael
3812,But I’m not kidding. I really want to do it.,"Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you’re up.",Michael
3813,Nope.,Ji.. why not? C’mon.,Michael
3814,"Oh, ’cause I don’t want my feet to get burned.",You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.,Michael
3815,That’s harsh.,Who’s next? Andy? Where’s Andy? Andy is never here today.,Michael
3816,Why don’t you go Michael?,Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.,Michael
3817,"And that is not the same at all. If you’re going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.",Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. ‘kay. The mind has to wrap around the foot. Okay.,Michael
3818,Do you want us to count to three?,"Yes. Count to three, please.",Michael

3823,GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB!,I’m not going to give it to you.,Michael
3824,Or Mrs. “Outside Hire.”,"Yeah. Ummm, hmm… True. Look, I don’t want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.",Michael
3825,Who’s Bob Hope?,God! He’s a comedian.,Michael
3826,"Oh, like Amanda Bynes.",Who’s Amanda Bynes?,Michael
3827,She’s from “What a Girl Wants.”,"Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.",Michael
3828,"Hey, I know what you’re looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don’t think I should be considered as your replacement.",You are being too modest.,Michael
3829,"Michael, on Thursday I’m going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.","Hhhh… okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.",Michael
3830,I mean truly repulsive acts.,"That is a very, very funny story.",Michael
3831,"Hey! I want to say something. I’ve been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn’t even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn’t any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It’s like sometimes some of you act like I don’t even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we’re not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn’t have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn’t care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you’re with someone else. And that’s… fine. It’s… whatever. That’s not what… I’m not… Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I’m just trying to say to you, Jim… and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It’s a good day.","Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.",Michael
3832,"Flintstones, meet the Flintstones. They’re a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da. From the town of Bedrock, they’re a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. When you’re with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we’ll have a gay old time!",WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!,Michael
3833,"Well, Bob was going to just drive me.","No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.",Michael
3834,You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don’t talk to him anymore really.,Acrimonious.,Michael
3835,"Um, What the hell?",It’s a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.,Michael
3836,"Um, I forgot my…","Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?",Michael
3837,Yeah!,"Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson.",Michael

3842,"I know, we’re putting on a play for Japanese investors.","No, we are not.",Michael
3843,Please tell me. I’ve been so good…,You are really annoying me. If you don’t knock it off…,Michael
3844,Please.,…I’m never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,Michael
3845,Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?,No. We’re only 10 minutes from the lake.,Michael
3846,Just one.,Yup.,Michael
3847,The torches are lit.,"Yes, for dramatic affect.",Michael
3848,"No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That’s a hazard.","Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?",Michael
3849,Are you not gonna put out the torches?,Set!,Michael
3850,Okay.,Go!,Michael
3851,"Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.",Because he wasn’t following the rules.,Michael
3852,I think they were just having fun.,"But they didn’t complete their task, Pam! If people can’t carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?",Michael
3853,It tells me nothing.,Exactly. Are you sure you’re doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.,Michael
3854,There’s 800 of them!,"Okay, all right.",Michael
3855,Hotdogs are really unhealthy.,Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!,Michael
3856,Is there any mustard?,"No mustard! No mustard! Just… eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.",Michael
3857,That’s what she said!,"No, no, no, no, not that— just… come on, you guys, let’s do it! I’m serious. Who’s got the hungry?",Michael
3858,I do!,Who’s got the hungry?,Michael
3859,I do!,"Come on, Ryan…",Michael

3861,"Michael, since Andy isn’t here, maybe I could be the team captain.",You? You haven’t made a sale.,Michael
3862,"I know, but I’d like to give this a try.",Don’t try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.,Michael
3863,"Oh, Michael?",Are we all set?,Michael
3864,Isn’t our interview tomorrow?,"Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I’d drop in and say hello.",Michael
3865,You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?,Thought I’d catch a show.,Michael
3866,In the middle of a work day?,"Naaah. You know what? Since I’m here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.",Michael
3867,Okay.,"Um, how many people are you interviewing?",Michael
3868,We’re only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.,"Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?",Michael
3869,I don’t think so.,Great. One more… question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?,Michael
3870,I believe we put you in charge.,"Ah, great. No further questions.",Michael
3871,"Okay, Michael.",Okay.,Michael
3872,I’m really looking forward to our interview.,And I’m really looking forward to working with you.,Michael

3879,Whoops.,"No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger…",Michael
3880,Heh.,Moon each other.,Michael
3881,"Ah, we’re gonna go tonight, but we’re gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?",All right.,Michael
3882,All right.,Your loss.,Michael
3883,"Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?",Cruise control.,Michael
3884,Do you think it’s gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?,"No. Not at all. I haven’t talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.",Michael
3885,Maybe you should talk to her? Before…,"No, no, no. You know what? It’s a done deal. I basically have the job already. There’s nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.",Michael
3886,"I’m sorry, that just doesn’t make sense.","Yes, I…",Michael
3887,"Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo…",I have to buy another place.,Michael
3888,You’re not sure that you have the job.,"I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.",Michael

3894,What do you want me to do?,"Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.",Michael
3895,What about Meredith?,No. She’s an alternate.,Michael
3896,Been good.,Good.,Michael
3897,Good.,Yeah.,Michael
3898,"Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.","Weird. Yeah, I didn’t get both of your messages.",Michael
3899,"After you ended… everything with us, I went on a vacation.",Hmm.,Michael
3900,To kinda clear my mind.,Sound good. Sounds fun.,Michael
3901,"It was. Yeah, it was good. I think I’ll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.",Hmm..,Michael
3902,I’ve made some big changes in my life and… I miss you. I want us to get back together.,Would you excuse me for a second?,Michael
3903,What are you gonna do?,"I don’t know, that’s why you’re here, help me. Please…",Michael
3904,Do you want to get back together with her?,"No, no. What do I do?",Michael
3905,Just don’t get back together with her.,What if she makes me?,Michael
3906,How can she make you get back together with her?,She made me do a lot of things I didn’t wanna do.,Michael
3907,This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.,I wasn’t.,Michael
3908,You’re so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.,You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I’m gonna go in there and tell her that we can’t be together.,Michael
3909,Right.,Wow.,Michael
3910,Do it.,I’m in a very good place right now. Thank you.,Michael
3911,So… there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.,Yeah.,Michael
3912,"I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.",First got priorities.,Michael
3913,And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation…,Let’s get back together.,Michael
3914,Thanks.,"Wait, wait. Check one more time.",Michael
3915,"Oh, okay.",Very good,Michael
3916,"Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?","Yes, indeed.",Michael
3917,What happened?,"Your advice was good, but Jan’s was bigger.",Michael
3918,"Uh, no, we’re good. Thanks.","I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody’s names. If you need to know somebody’s name, just ask me.",Michael
3919,Who’s that?,...,Michael
3920,Beardy?,Mm-hmm.,Michael
3921,I’m gonna introduce myself.,"No, no, no, just… that’s not his real name. That’s just what I call him, so…",Michael

3926,"Michael, good to see you!",Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.,Michael
3927,"Oh, great. I’ve been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn’t lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work. So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?",Why don’t I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.,Michael
3928,Okay. And your strengths?,"Well, my weaknesses are actually… strengths.",Michael
3929,Oh. Yes. Very good.,Thank you.,Michael
3930,What do you think we could be doing better?,"I’ve never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, “Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We’re GRRRRRRRRRREAT!” I don’t know, could be good. Or, uh, “Super Duper Paper. It’s super duper.” I don’t know, something like that.",Michael
3931,Okay!,Okay.,Michael
3932,"Thanks for comin’ in, Michael.",Thank you.,Michael
3933,It is always a treat when our paths cross.,It is always a treat when,Michael

3935,"Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position… the job you’re applying for… is Jan’s job.","I don’t understand. So, we’re gonna tag team it?",Michael
3936,Hey you!,Hey.,Michael
3937,How was your interview?,Pretty good.,Michael
3938,Yeah?,Could have gone better I guess.,Michael
3939,Oh. I’ll put in a good word for you.,Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.,Michael
3940,What?,"Daaah, let’s just run away together. Let’s just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would… be fine. We’d have fun.",Michael
3941,What’s… what’s the matter? What… what happened in there?,I can’t tell you.,Michael
3942,Is it because of these?,"Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan—",Michael
3943,The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable.,Hey!,Michael
3944,Yeah!,No— We’re all unstable.,Michael
3945,"Okay, you know what? I’m just not leaving. I’m not leaving. Not leaving.","David, I did not tell her.",Michael
3946,"Don’t let them change you, okay? So long, .","So, I am gonna… give her a ride home. Let me know about the job.",Michael
3947,"Actually, Michael, I think we’re gonna take it in another direction.","Good, I’m glad we’re on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions.",Michael
3948,"No, we’re not giving you the job.","You know what? That… is actually good… because, um, I don’t think I could take… my girlfriend’s job. That’s not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?",Michael
3949,I do.,"Good. Very good. I’m glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though.",Michael
3950,Yes.,Good. That’s all I ever wanted. These two. Either one of them… excellent candidates.,Michael
3951,"Oh, God! I mean, I just don’t understand! It’s just","I know. I know, I’m sorry about that. That was terrible.",Michael
3952,"Oh, just… No, actually I think it’s good, you know? It’s fine, actually, I do. I really think it’s great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so…","Well, it’s… No, don’t cry, it’s gonna be OK.",Michael
3953,"Oh, I know, I know. It’s just… I’m sorry. It’s just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do?",I don’t know. Well I guess… you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.,Michael
3954,How’d it go?,"No. No, Pam. I’m baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon.",Michael
3955,To intimidate my subordinates.,That’s stupid.,Michael
3956,It was Andy’s idea.,"You shouldn’t have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I’m baaaaaack. Ryan, coffee.",Michael
3957,I don’t do that stuff anymore.,"No, it’s for me, bimbo. Kids.",Michael
3958,Did… Karen get the job?,Back to work. Still waitin’ on that coffee.,Michael
3959,Where do you see yourself in ten years?,"Well, I’ve actually done a lot of thinking about that. And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids. And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth. And, because it’s the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.",Michael
3960,A… multivitamin?,"Well, I don’t know what it’s gonna be called, but… my point is, the future of this company is now. And the future… is me.",Michael
3961,"Michael, what happened?","Jan got fired. And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend. But more than that, I realized that… I couldn’t take a job that would take me away from this place. This is where I belong. This is… my home. And home is where the hardest.",Michael
3962,Home is where the,Heart is. That makes a lot more sense. You think they’d help each other out like that at corporate? I think not!,Michael
3963,Where?,"It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could… And she is going to be OK.",Michael
3964,So she’s really going to be fine?,"Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah… people have survived far worse.",Michael
3965,Thank God you were there.,Yeah.,Michael
3966,No need we can just check the security tapes.,Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.,Michael
3967,It’s only Meredith.,"Yeah, it’s only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.",Michael
3968,Hey… Why did you do it?,It was an accident.,Michael
3969,Was she talkin’ back?,No.,Michael
3970,Back? Why is that Michael?,"Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.",Michael
3971,Oh! Did you do this on purpose?,"No, I was being negligent. But she’s in the hospital, she’s fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in…",Michael
3972,Did this happen on company property?,"Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so… double jeopardy, we are fine.",Michael
3973,I don’t think you understand how jeopardy works.,"Oh, right, I’m sorry. What is: we are fine?",Michael
3974,You pushed Darryl out the window?,No.,Michael
3975,You shot Dwight?,"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I’m just trying to take everybody’s mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.",Michael
3976,"OK, we’re leaving for the hospital at 1.","So, like a freedom tree.",Michael
3977,Separate cars.,Pam.,Michael
3978,"Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we’ll sign it outside her room.",Pam.,Michael
3979,Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.,"Ok, good good, so we’ll just all go down there together at lunch.",Michael
3980,I…,Excellent!,Michael
3981,I was thinking that we…,Good work Pam.,Michael
3982,But…,"Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?",Michael
3983,You can’t be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.,"Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!",Michael
3984,She looks awful.,"No… OK, she always looks like that… That is not my fault.",Michael
3985,I think she’s awake.,No… She’s in a coma.,Michael
3986,No.,"OK… Meredith, Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.",Michael
3987,At the same time.,Yeah.,Michael
3988,This is weird.,"Brought you some balloons. Why don’t we… here you go. Tie these up, cheer up your tubes… Oh! Shhhh… For God’s sake!",Michael
3989,Whoa!,Nurse.,Michael
3990,"No don’t bother the nurse, just put it back in.",I am going to be sick… I’m gonna puke.,Michael
3991,Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I’ll see you guys at the office.,"Oh, OK… Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.",Michael
3992,"Michael, I’m not gonna do that.",Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.,Michael
3993,"No, that’s not. That’s next to cleanliness.","Well, just shhhh… just just…",Michael
3994,You cracked my pelvis,"Look, I just… I don’t understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.",Michael
3995,You’re not forgiven.,Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.,Michael
3996,It’s gonna be OK.,"OK, you know what? Everybody, let’s just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let’s just…",Michael
3997,"Michael, Angela’s cat died.",Sprinkles?,Michael
3998,...,"Oh, sh… I’m sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then… Sprinkles! God, that’s 3 things. I’ll tell you what’s going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.",Michael
3999,Like what?,Like park on it. Or dig up a body… Toby? Anything you want to tell us?,Michael
4000,Yeah.,Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.,Michael
4001,Dwight please!,"Dwight, you haven’t seen Meredith yet, have you?",Michael
4002,"No, I have not.","Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.",Michael
4003,"I do not respect her, but I will go.","Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.",Michael
4004,"Oh, Michael, you can’t ask about religious beliefs…",Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.,Michael
4005,"Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.","Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let’s just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.",Michael
4006,"I’m… um, Catholic.",OK.,Michael
4007,Presbyterian.,Alright.,Michael
4008,That’s Buddhist.,Are you sure?,Michael
4009,No.,What are you?,Michael
4010,"Well if you’re going to reduce my identity to my religion then I’m Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I’m restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.","OK, 1 Sikh, and…",Michael
4011,If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.,"Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there’s some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just… the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah… the body of a porcupine.",Michael
4012,"So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.","Oh God, Rabies?",Michael
4013,Mm-hmm.,"I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?",Michael
4014,"No, no. You’ve gotta be bitten by something.",This place is so cursed.,Michael
4015,"Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in… Lock jaw.","I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith’s life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.",Michael
4016,"Six of one, really.","Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! Oh… there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.",Michael
4017,"Michael Scott’s Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.",Pro-Am.,Michael
4018,"No, rabies… Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?","Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?",Michael
4019,Zero.,"Come on man, gotta step it up! It’s for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.",Michael
4020,Isn’t that your money?,"That… is for a good cause. Phyllis, how’s the rabies quilt coming?",Michael
4021,"Oh, it’s coming.","Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.",Michael
4022,Michael?,Yes.,Michael
4023,You cannot make me run.,OK.,Michael
4024,"It is not a real charity. It’s stupid Michael, and I’m not gonna do it.","Alright, alright.",Michael
4025,You didn’t run for me…,Shhh…,Michael
4026,…when I thought I had skin cancer.,I know that you’re probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.,Michael
4027,No.,"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields… And I was a peasant.",Michael
4028,I just don’t want to run. I didn’t bring my sneakers or my clothes.,"Well, you’re going to have to run, or you’re going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.",Michael
4029,"Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but… What do you think Michael, that’s over 25% of our funds?",Hmm… That’s a tough decision. Um… I always imagined it with a giant check. So…,Michael
4030,Yeah.,Yep.,Michael
4031,"Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that’s what you told me when I contributed.",You didn’t contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how’s that been going?,Michael
4032,And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.,What about a rabies nurse?,Michael
4033,"You know what though, I’ve actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",That’s possible. Look into that.,Michael
4034,Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith’s son.,Have you met that kid? He’s not going to college.,Michael
4035,"Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles.",Come in.,Michael
4036,Hey.,"Hey, hey, hey",Michael
4037,Oh my God.,What are you doing?,Michael
4038,You said come in!,"No I didn’t, just please don’t…",Michael
4039,Come in.,May I enter the room?,Michael
4040,Yes. Or come in.,See how I did that. That’s the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.,Michael
4041,You couldn’t have taken off all your clothes in the men’s room?,"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.",Michael
4042,"On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.",European offices are naked all the time.,Michael
4043,They’re so not.,Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so…,Michael
4044,Gross.,"That’s not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you’re an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don’t want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it’s not fair to people with rabies. And that’s the point, right? OK, let’s go have some fun.",Michael
4045,"I don’t know what your deal is, but he’s mine, OK? So hands off.","OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I’d like you to take a look into the face of rabies. That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three… too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something… Darryl what are you doing.",Michael
4046,I’m giving him a peanut.,"No, don’t give him… just, did you hear anything I said?",Michael
4047,Look how happy he is.,"He’s happy because he’s insane. You know what, that’s the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where’s the nurse? This is the reason we’re here.",Michael
4048,Hello Michael.,"Oh hey, I know you… Elizabeth?",Michael
4049,Yeah.,"Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.",Michael
4050,Mm-hmm.,"OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.",Michael
4051,"On your marks, get set…",Beow!,Michael
4052,That’s my boss! Yeah-ha baby!,"I am fast! I’m very fast! I’m like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.",Michael
4053,Water? Water? Water babe?,"No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water… solidarity!",Michael
4054,"You’ve got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby’s coffee before the race.","Excellent! …Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?",Michael
4055,You don’t understand.,Take bat bites seriously. Don’t get bit.,Michael
4056,"What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or…","I can’t finish. I feel so weak, I just…",Michael
4057,"Well, you’re probably dehydrated.",What do you want me to do Jim?,Michael
4058,Glass of water would be a start.,"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They’re deformed, and they’re abnormal, and… they’re illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don’t have any money. Public TV is bust. I can’t do anything about it, I can’t… you know. There’s just one of me, and there’s a thousand of them. And rabies wins.",Michael
4059,"Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.",That’s a good deal.,Michael
4060,"And Michael, you don’t have rabies. And chances are you’re not going to get it anytime soon. So… you don’t really have to think about it too much.","Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.",Michael
4061,"Yeah, but there’s other, better people out there who are helping.","You just don’t think I am capable, of making a difference.",Michael
4062,"I know you Michael, I saw you naked.","You don’t, you don’t know me. You’ve just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I’m the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this… GD 5k No, no!",Michael
4063,Hey Michael.,Hey Mer. How ya doing?,Michael
4064,Better.,"It’s ironic isn’t it? I mean I’m in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you’re in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.",Michael
4065,"I’m in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I’m not mad at you anymore.","Thanks, I’m not mad at you anymore. Wanna share?",Michael
4066,Sure.,"I’m not really sick. Nah, I’m good.",Michael
4067,"I’m sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",Well…,Michael
4068,There’s no proof of that.,That’s not…,Michael
4069,"That seems early, even for her.","That’s not what…no, no, I’m not saying that, that’s disgusting.",Michael
4070,Then… what are you saying?,I am saying… that… maybe I was drunk. Did you ever think of that?,Michael
4071,That’s…,Okay.,Michael
4072,It’s fair.,"You know what, why don’t go around the room and say one memory of Meredith. I’ll start. I liked her jumpers. They reminded me of Kindergarten. Jim?",Michael
4073,"So, how’s the view old girl? Oh! There’s a cemetery. You think that’s affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature…","Hey! Okay, okay, okay, You can just close that.",Michael
4074,See you guys.,"Let’s just… Why can’t you just forgive… Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off? How do you know that you weren’t born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?",Michael
4075,"Oh please, Michael.",I’m not going to leave until you forgive me.,Michael
4076,You’re gonna be here a,"Oh, okay.",Michael
4077,Conference room?,"Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex. I’m just saying, at least right here is cursed. Conference room, 10 minutes.",Michael
4078,Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?,We have to have done something wrong.,Michael
4079,You ran over an employee.,"That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.",Michael
4080,Mmm.,"Oscar, are you Santaria?",Michael
4081,"I was raised Catholic, but I’m agnostic now, so I guess I’m a secular humanist.","Oh. Great. We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.",Michael
4082,"Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?",Yes. It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.,Michael
4083,Oh.,Stupid.,Michael
4084,"Let… let’s pick it up, Phyllis!","Oh, slow! Oh, ho, ho, ho. You guys are going so slow…",Michael
4085,Go get him Bobby!,"Come on, I’m going backwards.",Michael
4086,Sic him!,"Oh, all right! All right! All right! All right!",Michael
4087,Sic him!,Okay!,Michael
4088,"You’re gonna be just fine, Michael! You’re gonna have a good life.",Thanks.,Michael
4089,Ohh.,I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.,Michael
4090,"Yes, uh some people in the office have complained…",Oh really.,Michael
4091,"…about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know I just wanted to remind it’s not appropriate to, to do that.","Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don’t think. I don’t think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don’t think it’s any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight…",Michael
4092,"Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So…",No way.,Michael
4093,"Ummm… yup. Yes, we are.",Woooah! Wow!,Michael
4094,Tuna!,Awesome!,Michael
4095,I knew it!,You guys! Yes! Yes!,Michael
4096,Yes.,"Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, stand up. OK, here we go. Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.",Michael
4097,"Actually, we’ve been dating for a couple months.","I love you guys, so much.",Michael
4098,Phone’s ringing.,"No, no, no Pam let ’em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.",Michael
4099,Did you plan it?,No.,Michael
4100,Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?,Blowing up balloons I thought.,Michael
4101,Hold on one second. Hey Pam! It’s great to see you. Is Michael in?,Hey!,Michael
4102,Yeah.,"There he is! There he is! He’s back! And he’s with a beard. He… He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I’m Tubs.",Michael
4103,OK. Should we get started?,"Ohh, yeah, let’s get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..",Michael
4104,"Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.",…business meeting —,Michael
4105,Stop that! Stop that!,That’s right! That’s right!,Michael
4106,You scared me.,"Fire guy. Don’t start any fires, Ryan.",Michael
4107,When he started the fire.,"Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You’re like our little man…",Michael
4108,"Michael and everybody, umm…",Beard.,Michael
4109,"…let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I’d like your respect. I am your boss now. You’re gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.","Oh, wow!",Michael
4110,So…,That’s a little kinky. I don’t swing that way.,Michael
4111,OK…,Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.,Michael
4112,Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?,"Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let’s get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in 10 minutes?",Michael
4113,Perfect.,"Sounds good. OK, alright.",Michael
4114,This is a massive overhaul. We’re getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.,"OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.",Michael
4115,Thank you everybody.,Ryan Howard everybody. Good job.,Michael
4116,We’re screwed.,Who is?,Michael
4117,Us? You and me. The old timers.,I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.,Michael
4118,"OK, what’s up?","Yeah, kay. I was just… After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?",Michael
4119,"Well it is business, but not as usual.","Yeah, I know I understand… we’re making great strides and we’re updating, but business as usual, no?",Michael
4120,"No. We’re throwing out the entire playbook, we’re starting from scratch, we’re implementing a brand new system.","Good, so, we’re on the same page?",Michael
4121,You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.,Hey.,Michael
4122,What?,I don’t want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.,Michael
4123,"So, what’s Ryan doing here?","Oh, I dunno, they’re launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He’s being a real twerp about it, so, it’s all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",Michael
4124,He’s such a snake.,Well…,Michael
4125,I hope he’s gets hit with an ageism suit.,What is that… word?,Michael
4126,"Ageism? Companies they can’t discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.",So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,Michael
4127,Ohh… man.,"Good, we’re all here, we can get started.",Michael
4128,Michael.,Have a seat.,Michael
4129,We’re not doing this today.,Have a seat. Like everybody else.,Michael
4130,OK. This is…,"Still my office, Ryan. Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also… illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.",Michael
4131,"Technically, he’s right.","Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",Michael
4132,Because they’re lame.,"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like “where’s the Beef?” Yeah.",Michael
4133,"Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.","I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.",Michael
4134,Michael Scott?,"That is me. Come on in. Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who’s this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?",Michael
4135,"Michael, can I talk to you a second?",Sure thing. ‘Scuse me.,Michael
4136,We have actual work to do.,Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.,Michael
4137,I’m 87.,"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",Michael
4138,"Well, I, I, I haven’t been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.","Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.",Michael
4139,I started this company in 1949.,Wow.,Michael
4140,"Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.","Oh, boy.",Michael
4141,"And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later… Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.",Great.,Michael
4142,"And he was, he was at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm… uhh… Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.",Great.,Michael
4143,And…,That’s great. Thank you for coming in. Robert Dunder everybody. Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?,Michael
4144,"Well I, I, I came here in a cab.",Perfect.,Michael
4145,"Well, cou, could you get me another…","Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, because it’s illegal, and you will go to jail.",Michael
4146,I think that I should help him get home.,"No, No. Don’t help him. He doesn’t need help, Pam. What a nice guy.",Michael
4147,"Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.","I disagree, I think it was very valuable.",Michael
4148,"Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.",I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.,Michael
4149,Dah! Come on!,Yeah! I know. I know. It’s bland.,Michael
4150,"Dude, you gotta believe.","Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?",Michael
4151,Wait for it.,"Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a “Where’s Waldo.”",Michael
4152,Oh! Yes!,Alright. Alright. Let’s quit while we’re ahead.,Michael
4153,That was so awesome.,That was awesome. Thank you.,Michael
4154,Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.,"Oh, does he?",Michael
4155,He does.,"Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.",Michael
4156,Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?,And… today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.,Michael
4157,"If that’s from Ryan, does it mention if he’s seeing anybody?",No. It doesn’t. I’ll find out tonight.,Michael
4158,Waste of time.,"What’s that, pipsqueak?",Michael
4159,"Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?","Ohh, lunch party.",Michael
4160,It’s supposed to say launch!,"Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.",Michael
4161,Waaay too tight.,Really?,Michael
4162,Why is it so tight?,It’s the European cut.,Michael
4163,Is just looks bad.,"Umm… hey. Ah, what’s hanging?",Michael
4164,Setting up the web-cam for the party.,Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?,Michael
4165,Depends… how much have you eaten already today?,"I had um, one of those danishes.",Michael
4166,"My friends? Michael, I was terminated.",Just…,Michael
4167,Is it really that important to you?,Yeah.,Michael
4168,Alright.,Thank you.,Michael
4169,Go by yourself.,Na… no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I’m a big loser.,Michael
4170,Well…,Do I have your permission to invite Carol?,Michael
4171,What? No Michael!,I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just the first… girl that popped into my head. I’ll find somebody I haven’t slept with.,Michael
4172,Sure we’ll go.,Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.,Michael
4173,One of the tickets is for him.,Just let me know who the winner is.,Michael
4174,I’m driving?,Yes. Thank you.,Michael
4175,"Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.","Oh yeah, you’d better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. I love ya Pam… okay. I’m leavin’ inside Jim’s car, I don’t know when I’ll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I’ll be back. I’ll be back. Tomorrow. Um… yeah. So you know what? Why don’t you guys take off a little bit early tonight?",Michael
4176,Because there’s a party! A party for the website I’ve been planning for two weeks.,"If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.",Michael

4202,Go-Go dancers?,"I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, “Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?”",Michael
4203,I can’t do this.,Yes you can.,Michael
4204,I can’t do it.,Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn’t say that if I didn’t hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?,Michael

4206,We get to go home?,"Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?",Michael
4207,Wait! Alfredo’s Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo?,Same thing.,Michael
4208,...,You know what? I don’t understand when you all talk at the same time.,Michael
4209,"Michael, there’s a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?",Pizza by Alfredo.,Michael
4210,...,"Okay, okay, what’s better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?",Michael

4212,The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.,You don’t have to say it like that.,Michael
4213,I said it normal.,Hey,Michael
4214,"Hey. Sixty-three fifty, and that’s not including tip.","Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.",Michael
4215,The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.,"Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.",Michael
4216,"I don’t care what you told them on the phone, that’s our policy.",You didn’t actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?,Michael
4217,It’s not pizza.,"Okay, it doesn’t say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it’s policy, it should say it on the coupon.",Michael
4218,...,What do you mean hmm-um?,Michael
4219,Not my problem.,"It is your problem. That’s no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.",Michael
4220,"Great story. It’s sixty-three fifty, and that’s not including tip.",I’m not giving that to you.,Michael
4221,Well then you’re not getting you’re pizzas.,"No, no you’re not going anywhere. You’re staying here until we figure this out.",Michael
4222,What?,"You know what? This young man needs to learn that’s not how you treat people. I don’t care if it’s pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.

4227,You better think about what you’re doing.,"No! I’m an adult, I don’t have to think or do anything. You’re a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he’s better than everyone else, because he’s some hot shot, and you don’t know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",Michael
4228,Sales?,"Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that’s called sales.",Michael
4229,A loser.,"Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.",Michael
4230,"Michael, Michael",Stop talking all at once!,Michael
4231,You need to let him go.,Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?,Michael
4232,Yes.,"You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.",Michael
4233,"Yes, but not by kidnapping.","I’m not kidnapping him, I’m keeping him until I get what I want.",Michael
4234,As a hostage.,I think you’re over-thinking it.,Michael
4235,I think you’re under-thinking it.,"Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I’m keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our…",Michael
4236,Ransom.,"Trouble. Okay, alright.",Michael
4237,What did he say?,He said no.,Michael
4238,"So, we should let him go.","No, no.",Michael

4241,"And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.","Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.",Michael
4242,Ahh-chaa!,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?",Michael
4243,"Shut up, or I’m going to punch you in the throat!","Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid.",Michael
4244,"You had to, what other choice did you have?",I could have paid for the pizza.,Michael
4245,"Well, yeah.","Oh my God, oh my God.",Michael
4246,"Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.",You’re breaking up. I can’t hear you.,Michael
4247,Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he’s being held against his…,"Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.",Michael
4248,What will you do?,I will open the door.,Michael
4249,Yeah.,"And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.",Michael
4250,"So, I’m paying full price?",Yes.,Michael
4251,"Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There’s two more.","See ya, drive safely.",Michael
4252,"See ya, drive safely.",Okay.,Michael
4253,Now what?,"Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.",Michael
4254,"Alright. Oh, I assume I’m going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.","Not now Dwight, please, it’s not the time.",Michael
4255,Blah.,Bluh.,Michael
4256,Uhh.,"Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I’d really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?",Michael
4257,What?,I’m going to get it.,Michael
4258,Coopers has calamari.,"Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.",Michael

4262,Woo-hoo.,Mmm.,Michael
4263,"I’m sorry, you guys are going to have to leave.","Hey, you know what? Come on, come on, let’s go.",Michael
4264,"Hey, you’re the Scranton guy.",Guilty.,Michael
4265,I liked your statement tonight.,"Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer.",Michael
4266,"Oh, very cool. It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.",Yeah.,Michael
4267,Later on.,"I’m Ryan, and tonight didn’t go the way that I thought it would, because it didn’t work out for me, and I’m very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.",Michael
4268,And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.,"I never sold any paper, because I’m an idiot.",Michael
4269,I started a fire with my cheese pita.,I made it with my cheese pita.,Michael
4270,I date Indian girls.,"I started a fire, I started a fire.",Michael
4271,"Now I’ve got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I’m your boss.","And I’m hot, I’m so hot. That’s why everybody…",Michael
4272,"I don’t get that, I don’t understand that.","Well, it’s part of it, it’s just the… uhhh.",Michael
4273,"Well, it’s part of it, it’s just the… uhhh.",Wanna head back?,Michael
4274,Excuse me?,"I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. Don’t avoid this. I know you’re dying to say it, so just say it.",Michael
4275,Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.,"What, no. No. Okay, bags. I have bags under my eyes, Pam. I didn’t see it at home, I didn’t see it in the bathroom, I didn’t see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light…",Michael
4276,"The city mirrors, or the…?","The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles? The big round things.",Michael
4277,The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?,"Yes. I have bags under my eyes, and I can’t go to New York like this! What do I do? What do I do?",Michael
4278,Put cold tea bags on your eyes.,Really?,Michael

4282,Like the main company number? Because I’m gonna have to call information.,Where’s Armani? He’s on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I’m so much better than you are.,Michael
4283,You finished the movie.,Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won’t ruin it for you.,Michael
4284,No. Go ahead.,"Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what’s best for you, Mo Chuisle.",Michael

4292,"Hold on, I’ll get them on the phone.","Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.",Michael
4293,"So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.","Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.",Michael
4294,"The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it’s so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?","You can not, I have a thing tonight.",Michael
4295,"Uh, Michael.",What?,Michael
4296,"That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.","Oh no, I have a thing tonight.",Michael
4297,Shoot!,How about this weekend?,Michael
4298,"We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.","Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.",Michael
4299,Where are you going out tonight?,You wouldn’t understand. It’s a secret.,Michael
4300,What’s going on here?,"Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.",Michael

4311,A few more minutes is a waste of our time.,It is not a waste of our time.,Michael

4317,I was a surgeon back home.,Really?,Michael
4318,Oh yeah.,Wonder what I would’ve been back home?,Michael
4319,Well this is your home.,"I know, but it’s competitive here. What’s a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.",Michael

4341,How long until you actually get this presentation ready?,"Why don’t you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?",Michael
4342,"You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.","Huh, okay.",Michael
4343,What?,"It’s whoever, not whomever.",Michael
4344,"No, it’s whomever.","No, whomever is never actually right.",Michael

4351,Are you quitting?,I am.,Michael
4352,I do gamble Michael.,"Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don’t know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he’s tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?",Michael
4353,The mob.,Do you know anybody in the mob?,Michael

4357,Michael.,"Hey, hey, hey.",Michael
4358,"Michael, are you having money problems?","Monkey problem? No, I’m not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?",Michael
4359,You heard me correctly.,"Oh, I hate monkeys.",Michael
4360,"What’s going on, why do you have a second job?",I don’t have a second job. Maybe I’m having an affair with Suzanne Summers.,Michael
4361,Doesn’t Jan have money?,"I don’t talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.",Michael
4362,"True, it’s best to hide our money problems from women.","I totally agree with you. But I don’t have money problems, I don’t. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this?",Michael

4364,"Hey cuz, heard you’re having money problems.",No you didn’t.,Michael
4365,"You don’t go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up “get out of jail free” cards, those things cost thousands.",That is a good point.,Michael
4366,"Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature’s do-over. It’s a fresh start, it’s a clean slate.",Like the witness protection program.,Michael
4367,"Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can’t just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.","I didn’t say it, I declared it.",Michael
4368,This is a lot of credit card debt.,"Yeah, tell me about it.",Michael

4370,"Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.","Oh, that’s the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",Michael
4371,Twelve hundred dollars. What’s a Core Blaster Extreme?,"That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that’s how they got a core.",Michael
4372,"Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.",Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.,Michael
4373,"The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.",Right.,Michael
4374,"This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.",How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?,Michael
4375,"Michael, I’m going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.","No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.",Michael
4376,She has to know.,"We will find another way, we’ll ask power-point.",Michael
4377,"Michael, this is a presentation tool.",You’re a presentation tool if you think I’m gonna tell Jan about this.,Michael
4378,I’m done!,"No you’re not! Ok, just… you’re not a tool. Look, we’ll tell her that it’s bad, but it could’ve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.",Michael
4379,Jan is smart.,She poses.,Michael
4380,You’re broke?,"Um, that’s, how did you get that from what Oscar’s saying?",Michael
4381,Michael.,Hey Jan.,Michael

4383,"Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going?",I’m out of answers Jan.,Michael
4384,What does that mean?,"I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you.",Michael
4385,"Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won’t solve anything. You know that.",I don’t know that.,Michael
4386,"Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.",I’ll stay off the grid.,Michael
4387,"Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It’s not that bad.","Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up.",Michael
4388,"Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn’t have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won’t even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.",That’s really nice of you to say.,Michael
4389,"Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That’s just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I’m going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where’s this train taking us?",I think the engineer left.,Michael
4390,I’m keeping them. I know you like them. They’re kind of uncomfortable though.,That’s nice though.,Michael
4391,It’s kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.,It looks cute though.,Michael
4392,"No, I don’t know.",Do you think I’ll get any new ones? I could…,Michael
4393,What?,"What do you mean, “what”?",Michael
4394,What…,Were you listening to what I was saying?,Michael
4395,I was aware that you were speaking.,What is the matter with you?,Michael
4396,What is the matter with… me?,Yeah.,Michael
4397,I’m… discombobulated.,Yeah.,Michael
4398,I need help.,"All right, well, go find some. Get outa here, please.",Michael
4399,"Okay, you need to focus, Michael. You need to stop spending money.",Yeah. What?,Michael
4400,"I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?","Um, my CDs.",Michael
4401,You have CDs?,I do.,Michael
4402,"Okay, good, okay. What bank?","My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic",Michael
4403,Case Logic.,"And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car. There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor What?",Michael
4404,I just think that…,I can’t.,Michael
4405,Why?,I can’t go back to that.,Michael
4406,I think you can. I… what?,I don’t know if I can do that. I can’t see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.,Michael
4407,"All right, well then maybe there’s another way, you know? I mean, we could just… we’ll think of something else.",We will? I can’t. I don’t have an idea in my head.,Michael
4408,"Well… well, we will.",I have…,Michael
4409,We just will.,Okay. What? Um…,Michael
4410,I have some ideas.,Tell me.,Michael
4411,I am not going to tell you yet.,"Well, please? I won’t tell anybody.",Michael
4412,"Oh, yes, you will.","Yeah, I will.",Michael
4413,Dancing babies!,Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!,Michael
4414,Football cream. Grr!,"Okay, it’s football cream. It’s football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?",Michael
4415,I’m taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.,"Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.",Michael
4416,"Hey, how ya doin’?",Michael Scott.,Michael
4417,"Hey, Michael.",Regional manager.,Michael
4418,"Hey Michael, nice to meet you",Excited to talk ideas.,Michael
4419,"Let’s do it, man.","You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.",Michael
4420,"All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.",I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The ‘Nard Dog. Who let the ‘Nard Dog out?,Michael
4421,Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!,He gives the best back rubs in the office.,Michael
4422,"It’s true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got ‘Nard dogged!",Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.,Michael
4423,Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.,Michael
4424,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.,"These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.",Michael
4425,Mama Bear!,Who else?,Michael
4426,Okay I can tell that your time is valuable—,"Actually I don’t get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so…",Michael
4427,"That all sounds really, really ambitious.","Yeah, I know.",Michael
4428,Why don’t we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?,Mmm. Okay.,Michael
4429,Mmm. Okay.,That’s what Nassau came up with? That sucks! Whoa.,Michael
4430,That’s what we came up with.,Well we can do better than that.,Michael
4431,"Yeah, it’s the last five seconds where we have some leeway.",The waving?,Michael
4432,Hello?,"Shrek! Shrek, I’m a donkey! I’m a donkey, Shrek! I’m just kidding. It’s me. Hello Ry.",Michael
4433,What?,"Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.",Michael
4434,I told you not to call about small problems.,"Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don’t like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.",Michael
4435,"That’s good. They’re creative, you’re not.","I’m creative, Ryan.",Michael
4436,"It’s not part of your job, it’s like, maybe you can cook but it doesn’t mean you should start a restaurant.","Well actually I can’t cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike’s Cereal Shack. I’m thinking we’ll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.",Michael
4437,"Okay, I’m not really interested in that right now. I’m delegating creativity to creative professionals. It’s a different skills set. Look, I wasn’t good at sales, right?",Yeah!,Michael
4438,But I’m good at managing people who do sales .,"Are you? I don’t think you’re doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.",Michael
4439,"Okay, when should we come back?","How about never hundred hours, sir.",Michael
4440,Okay I’m not going to argue with this guy. Let’s go. Good luck dude.,Hey thanks. Thank you.,Michael
4441,"Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people?","Yeah, I’m glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.",Michael
4442,I’m on Michael.,"What’s up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it’s ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we’ll do it on my dime.",Michael
4443,This is weird.,I’m willing to stake my entire reputation on it.,Michael
4444,"Okay, I’ll see it tomorrow.","Okay. And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.",Michael
4445,Yes.,"Well they’re wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.",Michael
4446,Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She’s doing a book signing right now.,"Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.",Michael
4447,Bye everyone.,Line it up Phyllis.,Michael
4448,The people person’s paper people.,"Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought… I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.",Michael
4449,What’s rap?,"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I’ll make you a mix.",Michael
4450,The people person’s paper people.,Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.,Michael
4451,The people person’s paper people.,"No, I hate it! I hate it! …I don’t hate it, I just don’t like it at all. And it’s terrible.",Michael
4452,"You’re on your own, Mike.","Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.",Michael
4453,You just said you hated it.,"No. I said I hate the, the style.",Michael
4454,Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.,"Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.",Michael
4455,Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.,"Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don’t get this, if we don’t nail it, we’re going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?",Michael
4456,"Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton’s book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn’t supposed to take no for an answer.",That’a girl.,Michael
4457,So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.,"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?",Michael
4458,No.,"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?",Michael
4459,Yes?,"Pam, please clear my phone lines.",Michael
4460,"Certainly. Okay, clear.",They could call at any second now. Oh God…I better call.,Michael
4461,Hey it seemed like a big hit.,"No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It’s not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.",Michael
4462,"Michael, that was fun.","That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!",Michael
4463,"Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it’ll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business.","There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.",Michael
4464,I spent three years in advertising before I came here.,"And that is probably why most ads suck. Oh, that’s them! Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film. Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?",Michael
4465,Yeah.,About dressing your best today?,Michael
4466,"Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.","Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.",Michael
4467,"Yeah, I get all the memos.","Okay, good. Good.",Michael
4468,Right.,"And if not we can just make him disappear. This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don’t you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.",Michael
4469,Okay.,"So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.",Michael
4470,I don’t want –,"No, that’s skeptical. Do sad.",Michael
4471,Mmm…,"That’s, that’s a pirate movie. That’s annoyed. Well, he doesn’t do very well under pressure.",Michael
4472,Yeah… no.,"And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace. Follow me! Let’s get this movin’.",Michael
4473,"All right! I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be doing, but…","You are my producer, you are a suit. I am the creative genius. You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.",Michael
4474,Yup.,"Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate…",Michael
4475,Right.,…and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.,Michael
4476,Mmmhmm. Why don’t you start by telling me what you got.,We start on a single blank sheet of paper.,Michael
4477,Love it.,And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.,Michael
4478,"Mm, can’t do that.","Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman’s womb.",Michael
4479,Definitely can’t do that.,Bull man!,Michael
4480,You know what?,This is bull!,Michael
4481,"Okay, Scott, why don’t you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.",Ahhhh!,Michael
4482,"I’m just doing my job, man.","If you don’t let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!",Michael
4483,Good! Fine! I’ve got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee…,"No! No! Jim, Jim, don’t, don’t…",Michael
4484,What? What?,"No, I can do it.",Michael
4485,What?,"I can do it good. I can do it good. Please, don’t. Please. Please give me it.",Michael
4486,"Okay, make a commercial.",Do you want this open or closed?,Michael
4487,...,I can’t hear you! Heard you a little bit less that time. Must be…,Michael
4488,We had already applauded.,"Okay, okay. Who could do music?",Michael
4489,How about Darryl?,"Actually, I’m a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a… celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.",Michael
4490,He looks like your twin.,"This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.",Michael
4491,I will know.,"But, you will not tell anyone.",Michael
4492,I won’t need to because we’ll be together playing hooky. Yeah.,"Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We’re going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?",Michael
4493,I don’t understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.,"Just go out, and come back in.",Michael
4494,"I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I’m going to take it.",What?,Michael
4495,...,"No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.",Michael
4496,"Oh, I don’t think that is what’s happening.","Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",Michael
4497,I think it’s because of my sales record.,That could not possibly be it.,Michael
4498,Money.,"Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so… Tell me why you’re really leaving.",Michael
4499,Money.,"Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-",Michael
4500,Money.,"Pssh, kay.",Michael
4501,Hello?,"Fillipellers, how’s it hanging?",Michael
4502,Michael…,To the left?,Michael
4503,"Listen, I-",To the right?,Michael
4504,I’m-,"Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.",Michael
4505,You called me.,"Yes, listen, um… You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",Michael
4506,I’m pretty sure his family’s coming with him.,"No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I’m going to give you my best man. You may have Toby.",Michael
4507,Toby’s not a salesperson.,"You can train him. He’s very very smart, and funny, and charming… You know, I can’t do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um… Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I’m going to poach one of yours.",Michael
4508,Oooh. Good-bye Michael.,"Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one?",Michael
4509,"I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.","Hi Ben, Michael Scott.",Michael
4510,Hi Michael.,"I’m going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I’m a genie in a bottle, and I’m going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.",Michael
4511,...,"Get out. Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that’s not as grabby.",Michael
4512,"Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn’t everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?","No, I fired them, and your next. … So what do you say?",Michael
4513,Found him!,"Jim, we’re getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.",Michael
4514,So what are you going to do?,"What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that’s what we’re going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples.",Michael
4515,Did they?,"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we’re going to crush this sale. We’re going to prove, what the hell is that music?",Michael
4516,"It’s Vivaldi, for Finer Things.","That’s the problem, that’s the problem. We need rock n’ roll Pam, rock n’ roll. Alright? Oh… My… God, that’s why people are leaving. I- I have no words.",Michael
4517,We just passed the exit for Corcroan.,What? What? We did?,Michael
4518,"Surprise! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.",Look at his face! Look at his face!,Michael
4519,"Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.","What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?",Michael
4520,"Well, gee, Jim, I don’t know, I guess there’s no sales call today.","We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we’re doing.",Michael
4521,We’re going to Utica?,Uh-huh.,Michael
4522,I’m not going to Utica right now.,"Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim.",Michael
4523,No.,We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.,Michael
4524,We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.,Utica! Utica! Utica!,Michael
4525,Utica! Utica!,In your face,Michael
4526,I can’t believe you guys. I’m not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.,Are you calling Karen?,Michael
4527,He’s lying.,"Yep, get it.",Michael
4528,No communication with the outside world Jim.,"It had to be done, it had to be done.",Michael
4529,Okay.,"Hey Dwight, he found it.",Michael
4530,You know what? I’m just going to call a cab from here.,"Alright, you’re going to miss the best prank ever.",Michael
4531,"Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?",Do you really wanna know?,Michael
4532,"Oh, God.","Follow me, come here. Here’s what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.",Michael
4533,Or real bombs.,"No, no, not real bombs.",Michael
4534,"Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.","Uh, maybe, maybe, I don’t know.",Michael
4535,No.,"It could be badass. Yeah, it will.",Michael
4536,Are you kidding me? We’ve been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?,Teach her to offer Stanley more money.,Michael
4537,What?,"I can’t imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is…",Michael
4538,"Okay, you know what?",…awesome.,Michael
4539,Why don’t we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?,"Okay, I will start. Um, “A.” “A” my name is Alan, and my wife’s name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell… Damn it! What do we sell? Um…",Michael
4540,It doesn’t matter.,I’m trying to think of what we could sell.,Michael
4541,Doesn’t matter.,"Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound… The air-conditioning leaking or something?",Michael
4542,"That doesn’t make sense, couldn’t be.","What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?",Michael
4543,Oh my God!,"Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!",Michael
4544,"Hey, you’re making me spray!",I’ll kill you man!,Michael
4545,"Michael! Michael, pull over!",That is just so disgusting!,Michael
4546,Believe it.,"Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?",Michael
4547,"No, Michael. I’m not leaving the car.","Yeah, Dwight, here’s how it’s going to go down. You and I-",Michael
4548,Guy’s going by. Shh.,You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.,Michael
4549,Well…,"There’s a guy, there’s a guy.",Michael
4550,"There’s a security guard coming by. Hello, we’re warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?","Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.",Michael
4551,"Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.","We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier.",Michael
4552,Isn’t that thing huge?,"It’s enormous, but it’s got wheels. We’re wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running.",Michael
4553,"No, that is a terrible idea, don’t do this.",Aha!,Michael
4554,My hip bone!,"We’re wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us.",Michael
4555,Don’t leave us!,Save yourself!,Michael
4556,"Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all-","Dwight, you gotta move!",Michael
4557,Damn it guys!,"Dwight, could you move over a little bit.",Michael
4558,Did you say Karen?,"Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.",Michael
4559,"No, I’m not doing that.",Just say you wanna get back together.,Michael
4560,"No, I’m not doing that!","It doesn’t have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.",Michael
4561,Then we will burn Utica to the ground.,"Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley’s head, we will burn Utica to the ground.",Michael
4562,Michael? A word?,Of course.,Michael
4563,"I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.",Really?,Michael
4564,"Well, you’re driving, right?","Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.",Michael
4565,Wait! I wanted to sit next to you.,"No, Dwight! Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me. You’re gonna sit in the back left where I don’t have to see your ugly moongob.",Michael
4566,"Okay, that is so mean! You know what, I’m not going.","I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Dwight, you’re handsome. You’re a very handsome man, get in the car.",Michael
4567,Scranton rules!,"Dwight! Stop it! Can you help me please, I’m being crushed.",Michael
4568,You embarrassed me.,You embarrassed us.,Michael
4569,"Oh, it wasn’t camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat.",Morning.,Michael
4570,"Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience","Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.",Michael
4571,Got it.,"So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?",Michael
4572,Yeah?,"Oh, you wanna go today?",Michael
4573,"Oh, can’t go today, ’cause I’m donating blood.",How often can you actually donate blood?,Michael
4574,Is there a limit?,Your body only has a certain amount.,Michael
4575,"Well, is that it? Or?","Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.",Michael
4576,How so?,"A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s’mores?",Michael
4577,What’s that?,"Hello, I’m Broken Mountain. You know, here’s the thing. That’s not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself—",Michael
4578,Right.,"In the wilderness. It’s not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It’s one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.",Michael
4579,Not gonna change.,"I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.",Michael
4580,I thought we had that looked at.,I’m sick of it Jim. I’m sick of this place.,Michael
4581,I’m on it.,"OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. Hey, what…",Michael
4582,Let’s see if any of these will work.,"Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.",Michael
4583,Do you want me to ask where you’re going?,No.,Michael
4584,Great.,Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.,Michael
4585,Oh.,Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.,Michael
4586,"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?","Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.",Michael
4587,"OK, great.","This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.",Michael
4588,Yup.,"When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.",Michael
4589,"No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.","Well, yes I would. And I would survive.",Michael
4590,I would make sure that you were dead.,Well…,Michael
4591,"First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.",You…,Michael
4592,And they would call me the Overkill Killer.,You… you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. OK.,Michael
4593,What are you doing?,"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can’t retrace my steps. I don’t know what streets we’ve been— Ow! What are you doing?",Michael
4594,It would be better if you were unconscious.,"No! Gosh! Dwight. Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",Michael
4595,Do you want to do this right or not?,"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?",Michael
4596,We’re here.,Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.,Michael
4597,Good a spot as any.,"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just —",Michael
4598,I’m just —,Stop.,Michael
4599,Spin. I’m trying to confuse your sense of direction. Behold.,"Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.",Michael
4600,Here’s your knife. Here’s your duct tape.,"Alright, very good. Ahh, OK.",Michael
4601,"Good luck, Michael.","Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.",Michael
4602,Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you.,"Yeah! Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want — OK, alright. Yeah, don’t do that. You’re gonna break something.",Michael
4603,Hey.,What up?,Michael
4604,Sure glad you’re back.,You are relieved.,Michael
4605,You have no idea.,So what did I miss?,Michael
4606,"Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.",Oh.,Michael
4607,"So, terrible idea.","Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.",Michael
4608,You did do it?,"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you’ll figure it out.",Michael
4609,"Well, I don’t think I’ll be here in ten years.",That’s what I said. That’s what she said.,Michael
4610,That’s what who said?,"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.",Michael
4611,That’s what she said.,"Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.",Michael
4612,"Oh, it’s Creed’s birthday today. Should we get him an ice-cream cake? Mint chocolate chip?","Pam, are you my friend?",Michael
4613,"Oh, no.","We have been friends forever, right?",Michael
4614,"Yes, I have been working with you forever.","Hypothetically… would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you? And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping. That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.",Michael
4615,I do.,"So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?",Michael
4616,No.,Thank you for your honesty.,Michael
4617,You’re welcome. Open or closed?,"Split the difference. Hey… mint chocolate chip, please? Is Jim out there?",Michael
4618,No.,Can you send Dwight in here?,Michael
4619,You wanted to see me?,"Mmhmm. I had something very personal I would like to discuss. Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?",Michael
4620,"And this… is a Hassenfass. Case-hardened steel. One side, as sharp as you’d ever want something to be. The other side serrated for maximum damage.",Okay.,Michael
4621,Look at that. Perfectly balanced. This is a fine precision instrument.,"All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.",Michael
4622,Don’t you want a sheath for that?,"No, just get me a case. All right.",Michael
4623,Anything else? Flint…,MmMmm. All I need…,Michael
4624,Parka…,"No, Dwight!",Michael
4625,"Tent, rainfly, gorp…","I’m telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.",Michael
4626,Mmmnnnnmmm…,What is this called again?,Michael
4627,Do you have any idea what time we’ll get out of here?,"Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. Do you have plans tonight?",Michael
4628,"Nope I don’t, remember when you told us not to make plans ’cause we’re working.","Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate.

4717,"Wow, you did neighborhood watch?",Yes.,Michael
4718,"I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.","So she’s passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors’ dog…",Michael
4719,Yeah.,And the neighbors blamed Jan.,Michael
4720,"Yeah. But, you know, it was my fault.","It’s like, you know, the dog shouldn’t have been outside in the first place. Anyway, it’s a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds…",Michael
4721,Mm-hmm.,So…,Michael
4722,Yeah.,Well.,Michael
4723,Did you pick a new chair? It’s been awhile.,"Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.",Michael
4724,Her?,Hmm…,Michael
4725,The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?,"Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She’s got – I don’t know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.",Michael
4726,Or in a great chair.,"Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?",Michael
4727,I definitely remember your dinner party.,I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.,Michael
4728,"If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I’d take her for myself.",I thought that you were engaged?,Michael
4729,Nope. Stacy broke up with me.,"Whaaaat? God, that’s terrible man. Eghh, she’s crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?",Michael

4736,Umm I don’t know Michael.,"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?",Michael
4737,What are you asking?,I think I’m being very clear what I’m asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? It bothers me that you’re not answering the question.,Michael
4738,"No, alright no, she can’t fit in a row boat.","Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!",Michael
4739,I don’t think that this is—,"Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don’t wanna hear “Ahnnn… I can’t help elhh la la.” No. No. I’m a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we’re going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.",Michael
4740,"Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.",Hmm..,Michael
4741,"No, thirty.","Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so… Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. OK, yes that would be bad.",Michael
4742,Yes.,That would be bad.,Michael
4743,…So help us out.,"Wish I could, but I can’t. Well can, but won’t. Should, maybe, but shorn’t.",Michael
4744,"Michael, please he–","What part of shorn’t don’t you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.",Michael
4745,We won’t let you down.,"Oh you can’t because I don’t care. Listen, don’t forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.",Michael
4746,Wendy’s.,"Hello Wendy, this is Kevin’s friend, Michael.",Michael

4748,"Dude, this is a Wendy’s restaurant.","Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?",Michael
4749,You have to come to the restaurant to order food.,"Well, I’ll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.",Michael
4750,It’s ready now.,Well put it aside. Umm… yeah.,Michael
4751,"OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.",Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm… this one says chair model…,Michael
4752,"I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn’t have to settle. This is my pledge to you.

4753,She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.,"Oh, God. Oh…",Michael
4754,"Michael, you didn’t even know her.",Try not to be so hurtful Jim.,Michael
4755,"Jim, how dare you.","Please, not at a time like this.",Michael
4756,"OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.",Oh really? What’s her name? Burger King?,Michael
4757,"No, I mean it. She’s really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along.","I don’t, I don’t think I’m ready. Is she hot?",Michael
4758,We need to assemble the five families.,"No, not the five families.",Michael
4759,Michael?,Ugh.,Michael
4760,Are you Michael Scott?,Is who a Michael what?,Michael
4761,"Oh, I’m sorry, I’m, I’m supposed to be meeting someone named Michael.","Oh, that’s not, yeah I’m not… OK…",Michael
4762,You’re asking what I do with the checks that people write to me?,Just making conversation.,Michael
4763,I don’t know.,You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. Look at that.,Michael
4764,She’s beautiful.,"Yeah. Yeah, and you can’t see her whole body. Down here, she’s got a boob job. Just… she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don’t know.",Michael
4765,I’m gonna head out.,"Oh, OK. Well, umm… I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.",Michael
4766,That’s incredibly rude.,Now you ruined it.,Michael
4767,She’s sweet and cute. I thought you’d get along.,"Oh, OK, Well I’m looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I’m a man… of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God…",Michael
4768,You know what you need? Closure.,You’re right. What do you mean though?,Michael
4769,"There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.",Hmm.,Michael
4770,I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.,God.,Michael
4771,Yeah.,She was so innocent.,Michael
4772,She was stoned apparently.,"You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that’s just silly because she’s dead. What do you do?",Michael
4773,You wait until next year’s chair catalog comes out and you find someone who’s still alive.,"Oh, you move on.",Michael
4774,"OH! You believe in rock ‘n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you’re in love with him. ‘Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. ‘You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues…",Return.,Michael

4777,"Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.",You were charging me? I’m your friend.,Michael
4778,You occupied the America room for six weeks. That’s our most popular room.,There was no other guest the entire time I was here.,Michael
4779,Right. Because you were in the America room. In an election year.,"Okay. All right, Dwight. Take my money. Go ahead. Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.

4780,"Okay. All right, Dwight. Take my money. Go ahead. Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.

4857,OK I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital.,Pretty weird.,Michael
4858,Uh huh. I’m not gonna call her.,Let’s go.,Michael
4859,I don’t wanna go back in.,"I know, here we go.",Michael
4860,Wow.,This is it.,Michael
4861,All right.,This is where the magic happens.,Michael
4862,Nice.,Very nice.,Michael
4863,I got sofa. I got sofa.,"Dwight, I’m the boss.",Michael
4864,I got floor.,"Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don’t wannna get my head stepped on.",Michael
4865,No.,"Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.",Michael
4866,It’s a lullaby.,"Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we’re going to take your clothes off.",Michael
4867,I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.,"Shh, just stop. Here’s what you do. You tell him that you’re his friend and that you’re gonna help him and that everyone’s gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who’s selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who’s really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don’t understand a word of it.",Michael
4868,OK. Good night Ryan.,Best night ever.,Michael
4869,"Ohhh, man! There it goes.","Ahh, ooh!",Michael
4870,"I am so sorry. I’m so sorry, sir.","Come on, come on.",Michael
4871,Dehydration.,"Here we go, let’s sit down.",Michael
4872,It’s dehydration. He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.,"All right, shhh. Dwight, leave him alone.",Michael
4873,Friends with a hobbit.,"Frien..sss…yes, you’re friends with a hobbit, and… look where you live. I mean, you’ve got it all.",Michael
4874,"Yeah, New York is great.","No, I mean this apartment building, it’s fantastic.",Michael
4875,"Oh, this, this is not my apartment. This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.","Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.",Michael
4876,Yeah.,Do you ever miss us?,Michael
4877,Not really. New York is…so great.,Ryan?,Michael
4878,Yes.,Do you remember what color my eyes are?,Michael
4879,Hazel. They’re hazel.,"Dwight, I asked him.",Michael
4880,"No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.",Really?,Michael
4881,Yeah.,Not just because he said it?,Michael
4882,No.,Ryan?,Michael
4883,Michael we don’t know what you’re talking about…,"Wet cement, outside. It’s drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?",Michael
4884,Michael you could put your initials in it.,M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don’t…,Michael
4885,Yeah that’s true.,"Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!",Michael
4886,We– we–,Here we go!,Michael
4887,Well–,"Let’s, yes?",Michael
4888,When I was a little girl…,"Okay… Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let’s hear it!",Michael
4889,We-we found some wet cement in the park…,"It’s drying, it’s drying…",Michael
4890,In our neighborhood…,"Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!",Michael
4891,What did we write?,Ahh come on!,Michael
4892,"Here it is, you should draw a picture…",No!,Michael
4893,"Cause that says, that says…",No!,Michael
4894,So much more than words…,"No!! Come on, gimme something good!",Michael
4895,"Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good…","Pam, translate.",Michael
4896,She’s talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.,I love it!,Michael
4897,If you were a real star you would put your face in it.,I love it more!,Michael
4898,Michael that doesn’t seem… safe.,"I… love it!! Haha, come on!",Michael
4899,"We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea… Maybe the idea of a man.","Hurry, please.",Michael
4900,And… go. Force it in as deep as you can.,That’s what she said.,Michael
4901,I don’t have my contacts…,"Ub, dub dah, don’t need, I can’t even hear you. It’s just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we’re going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.",Michael
4902,"Well, it’s too late, because I’m proposing… that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.","Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven’t done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?",Michael
4903,"What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more… zing, and a little more pep?","Zing and pep, see that’s those are the kind of words we’re looking for. Yes, Jim?",Michael
4904,What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?,"Now we’re cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme…",Michael
4905,An urban thing…,"An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?… Stanley, earth to Stanley…",Michael
4906,Not me.,"Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.",Michael
4907,No.,"Stanley, we’re havin a little…",Michael
4908,"Leave me alone, dammit.",We’re havin a little brainstorm session…,Michael
4909,DID I STUTTER?,"…Good, this is good. I’m going to grab a glass of water.",Michael
4910,Can I talk to you a second?,"Ugh, what?",Michael
4911,"Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning…",What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.,Michael
4912,"Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.",That? In the conference room?,Michael
4913,Yeah.,"We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said “did I stutter,” and I said “wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?” It was joking, Toby, alright?",Michael
4914,He didn’t seem like he was joking.,"Well you don’t get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you’re… you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: “Hey um, you’re poor.” “Well hey, you’re mama’s dead.” That’s what friends do. It’s… you’re so white.",Michael
4915,"Alright… Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking…",Mmhmm.,Michael
4916,"Um, why don’t you go ask him that?","Okay, I will… I’m not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but…",Michael
4917,"You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter’s stomach hurts when there’s a mean girl at school…","Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it’s probably psychological.",Michael
4918,What.,"I, uh, see that you… gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.",Michael
4919,What are you talking about?,"Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn’t mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing’s silly, isn’t it? Friends don’t need to apologize to friends as far as I’m concerned, so we are cool.",Michael
4920,"Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line–green for money-sales, get it?",Uh huh…,Michael
4921,There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley…,Great,Michael
4922,"However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.",What’s the pink?,Michael
4923,Menstrual cycles.,"Ok… Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?",Michael
4924,You.,Other than me.,Michael
4925,"Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.",I never said you could do that.,Michael
4926,All you have to do it say it.,I…,Michael
4927,Just say it.,"Okay, I will think about it.",Michael
4928,"Say it. Just do it. Don’t think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two… do it. Give me control. Michael… I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.",No.,Michael
4929,Mike.,Hey.,Michael
4930,"I’m very busy here, man.","Darryl, have you ever been in a gang?",Michael
4931,Why?,"It’s an advice question, and if you don’t wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It’s, um…",Michael
4932,"No, no, no…","I know, it’s very, very personal…",Michael
4933,"No, um… I have.","I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?",Michael
4934,Both.,God.,Michael
4935,"Yeah them, and the Latin Kings… the Warriors…",Okay.,Michael
4936,Newsies.,"Okay, so dig this: you’re on the street, and one of your gang disses you.",Michael
4937,Oh my goodness.,"Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?",Michael
4938,"Well see, um… in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.",What is that?,Michael
4939,"That’s when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just… start tickling them.",Really?,Michael
4940,"Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you’re laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you’ve forgotten the whole thing. Ya’ll can just go to church together… get an ice cream cone.",I would’ve never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.,Michael
4941,What does that mean?,It’s like a mock execution.,Michael
4942,That’s not a good idea.,Yes it is a good idea. It’s the only possible solution I have left.,Michael
4943,"Well, you can actually fire him.","No, okay… I’ve had enough of you.",Michael
4944,Why are you telling us this?,"Because I want you to behave as if I’m actually firing him, Oscar, okay?",Michael
4945,"Michael, if you hadn’t told us this, then we would’ve thought that you were actually firing him.","I’m not firing him. I’m not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I’m going to do, is I’m going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I’m teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That’s all I’m, okay, here he comes. Let’s just… play act. Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?",Michael
4946,Are you serious?,"I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.",Michael
4947,You’re firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I’m gonna let you do this to me?,Hmm.,Michael
4948,"I’ve watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I’m filing a lawsuit, and I’m gonna tell them about every stupid thing you’ve ever done up in this office.","Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.",Michael
4949,So I’m not fired.,That’s it. And uh… do you have anything to say to me?,Michael
4950,"Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?",Okay…,Michael
4951,Do you have any idea how to run an office?,Yes.,Michael
4952,Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.,That’s not-,Michael
4953,"And I think, “there’s no possible way–","All right, all right…",Michael
4954,He can top that.”,Okay.,Michael
4955,"But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!","Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.",Michael
4956,Who?,"Everybody, except Stanley.",Michael
4957,"Oh, for the love of God.","You just, do, and I don’t know why, so… please help me understand.",Michael
4958,"Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.","Well Stanley, maybe you’re feeling that you don’t respect me because you don’t know me very well.",Michael
4959,"Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I’ve gotten to know you, the less I’ve come to respect you. Any other theories?","All right, you don’t respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can’t talk to me that way in this office, you just can’t. I am your boss. Can’t allow it.",Michael
4960,That’s the dumbest thing I ever heard.,"Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.",Michael
4961,Who else is he mean to?,"Everybody. He just, he’s always, he’s always talking about people behind their backs to me.",Michael
4962,What kind of stuff does Stanley say?,"Like that people are stupid, and that they’re idiots, and that they’re sluts.",Michael
4963,Why would he say that?,"Because he’s mean. He’s, he’s like a really mean-spirited guy. He talks about how gay Oscar is…",Michael
4964,Mm-hmm.,"And that Angela’s a midget, and that your chin is too big.",Michael
4965,Hey.,"I know, I know. I think it’s tiny. I think it’s too small if anything. And that your glasses make you look ugly.",Michael
4966,She’s never worn these glasses before.,"Well, he’s just mean.",Michael
4967,"Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude. Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.","It’s complicated, Pam. I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.",Michael
4968,"Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what? Looking can be as bad as touching.",Okay.,Michael
4969,"Hi, Pam.",Pretty disgusting.,Michael
4970,Yes.,"Yeah, I’m pretty excited too.",Michael
4971,"Hey, are we doing this thing?",Yup.,Michael
4972,"Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I’m dating Barack Obama!",Why are you dressed like that?,Michael
4973,Like what?,Like you’re applying for a loan.,Michael
4974,I think you look nice.,Thank you.,Michael
4975,Thank you.,"Okay, here’s what we’re going to do: I’m going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No… uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don’t have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain’t going to college.",Michael
4976,What college did you go to Mike?,Let’s go!,Michael
4977,"Um, that’s all we brought.",This is all we need.,Michael
4978,We’ll see.,"Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! Hello!",Michael
4979,"Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.",Hello. Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.,Michael
4980,"This is Michael, my boss. Justin.","Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, “only the best and the brightest.”",Michael
4981,He’s nice and he seems interested.,"He’s totally wrong, Pam. Hey.",Michael
4982,Hi.,"How you doing? Listen, I don’t think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a… migraine worker. Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.",Michael
4983,Sorry for wasting your time.,"Oh, no problem. And he signed! He put his name on the piece of – okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.",Michael
4984,I only brought the one.,Are you mental?,Michael
4985,"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, “Are you sure Michael?” And you said “Pam! Pam! Pam!” And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, “Don’t worry, it’s just allergies.” Do you remember that?",I… don’t.,Michael
4986,Okay. I’ll go look for another one.,And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.,Michael
4987,What is this company?,"Well it’s funny that you should ask, because it’s really more than a company…",Michael
4988,Thanks.,"Dammit, Oscar!",Michael
4989,"Michael, I know you’re swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.","Who cares? I’m not there, Jim’s not there, why should they have to be there?",Michael
4990,A piece of paper.,This isn’t Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.,Michael
4991,Well I think they’ll get the spirit of it.,Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We’re dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.,Michael
4992,Are you serious?,Yes. And don’t call me Shirley.,Michael
4993,Hi.,Just-in case. What’s your last name?,Michael
4994,Polznik.,This… just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?,Michael
4995,Hi.,"This is Darryl Philbin. Isn’t he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will “do” you. No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?",Michael
4996,Excuse me.,"Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.",Michael
4997,"Why, why wouldn’t you say that to her face?","So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn’t bring are even better. Justin, I’m willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.",Michael
4998,You didn’t want me before. That’s what you said.,"No, I didn’t. You misconstrued me.",Michael
4999,You were kind of a jerk to me.,"I, uh, hmm.",Michael
5000,"And I’m, I’m gonna go now.",Why don’t… hey.,Michael
5001,The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.,"Hold down the fort, I have to do something. Excuse me. If you can hear me, I’d like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don’t even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that’s not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn… it. Okay, I’m gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.",Michael
5002,"Brad Bailey, nice to meet you.","That is a very firm handshake. Ow, ow, aahch! Killing my hand, there.",Michael
5003,Yeah.,"So, what is your poison? You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like…",Michael
5004,"Sales, uh, sales would be cool.","Sales is and could be very, very cool. If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.",Michael
5005,"Well, that’s great.",Right here. We have a lot of fun.,Michael
5006,Mmhmm.,"This is one of our staff. This is Pam Beesly, receptionist extraordinaire.",Michael
5007,"Hey, Pam, what’s up?","Check that out, huh?",Michael
5008,"Hi, nice to meet you.",Pretty nice.,Michael
5009,Yeah.,She sits there all day.,Michael
5010,Nice.,You get to look at her. Why don’t you hold out your hand. Tell me what you feel.,Michael
5011,Paper.,"That’s called card stock. That’s what you’re feeling. Now what you’re feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration… You’re thinking, “Am I good enough for this job? Do I have what it takes?” And I think we both know the answer. We’ll find that out together. You can keep that.",Michael
5012,Are you sure?,"Mmm, yeah.",Michael
5013,Sweet.,"Don’t fold it, though.",Michael
5014,"Well, it was nice meeting you, I’m, I’m gonna take off.","Hey, you know what? Coincidence – I am going to go for a little stroll myself. Are you psyched about the summer?",Michael
5015,"Oh, yeah.","Yeah, me, too.",Michael
5016,"Okay, well, I’m gonna go to the bathroom.","Okay, be my guest.",Michael
5017,Thanks.,And do your worst.,Michael
5018,"Whoa, come on!","So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this…",Michael
5019,"Yeah, I get it, okay, I’m not interested. Stop following me around; you’re really starting to creep me out.",One other thing I wanted to…,Michael
5020,"Nnn, look. I was just being polite. I don’t want to waste my life selling paper for your stupid company, okay?",Ohh…Nah.,Michael
5021,"I’m sorry, I’m sort of in the middle of this.","Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?",Michael
5022,"Absolutely. Justin is smart, capable, ambitious, and he aims high.",Time out. You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?,Michael
5023,Okay.,Okay.,Michael
5024,"Well, you took away the brochure, so I sort of…","Well, yeah, but you don’t need the brochure. The brochure is up here and it’s in here.",Michael
5025,Oh.,"I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.",Michael
5026,That’s what the recruiter just said.,I’m right.,Michael
5027,Morning.,"Mornin’. So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I’m going to set my watch alarm… And…",Michael
5028,We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.,Okay.,Michael
5029,But so far we only have two pictures of him.,"Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets…",Michael
5030,"Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans’ funeral?","If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?",Michael
5031,Michael…,"Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-",Michael
5032,No. You know-no!,Toga!,Michael
5033,"You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides… although Toby won’t be in them.",I thought that you might say that.,Michael
5034,"No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don’t want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.","Phyllis, can you do this?",Michael
5035,I want to introduce you to…,Toby’s replacement. Ugh. Wow.,Michael
5036,So what do we know about her?,"Well, we know that Toby thinks she’ll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.",Michael
5037,I hate her too.,Why do you hate her?,Michael
5038,Because she… stinks… with her… ways… and her… head.,"You know, Dwight, sometimes… I don’t know, I think you say things just to agree with me.",Michael
5039,Would that be such a bad thing?,"Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?",Michael
5040,What?,We need to sell her an elevator pass.,Michael
5041,"But our, our elevator doesn’t require a pa…",Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.,Michael
5042,Hey Michael.,"Oh, hey, do you still work here?",Michael
5043,I’d like to introduce you to my replacement.,Nah.,Michael
5044,Come on.,No. I think I will pass.,Michael
5045,Hi.,"Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here’s how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I’m gonna win.",Michael
5046,"Man, someone doesn’t like H.R.",Yeah.,Michael
5047,Nothing.,T-No. He tortured me… with his awfulness.,Michael
5048,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I’ll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.",Y-You can-Michael.,Michael
5049,Yeah.,"Here she is! Holly… You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we’d have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?",Michael
5050,"Oh… Nice, I’ve never heard that one before actually.",I bet.,Michael
5051,That’s good.,I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?,Michael
5052,"No, no, I…","Oh… What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?",Michael
5053,"Ooh, uh…","You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?",Michael
5054,Um… Y-yeah. Okay.,All right.,Michael
5055,Thanks.,Yep.,Michael
5056,That’s not it.,Music…,Michael
5057,Yeah.,For a CD mix tape…,Michael
5058,Close.,For Holly.,Michael
5059,Mmhmm.,And I’m looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.,Michael
5060,What are the two levels?,"The two levels being, uh, “Welcome to Scranton”…",Michael
5061,Mmhmm.,And “I… love you.”,Michael
5062,Okay. Let’s start with the “I love you” level.,"Hey, what’s the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?",Michael
5063,Yes. You don’t love Holly.,I think I do.,Michael
5064,But you just met her.,"Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.",Michael
5065,"Oh, okay, it doesn’t work like that.","Well, you’re not a romantic.",Michael
5066,"Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.",Oh really?,Michael
5067,Yeah.,"Like, with who?",Michael
5068,We’ve been through this.,Pam?,Michael

5283,Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.,"Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.",Michael
5284,Yes.,Can’t set ’em up like that.,Michael
5285,Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.,Can we have a moment? Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look… you look fantastic.,Michael
5286,Michael.,Yeah.,Michael
5287,What should we be working on while you guys are talking?,"Do some… do some work. People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan.",Michael
5288,"Well, I just have to get through the binder.",Do you… just… you’re kind of losing them.,Michael
5289,"Ok. Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let’s just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil. That’s not right.","Lauren, enough with the pencils.",Michael
5290,No that’s… not how it works.,I would not… steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.,Michael
5291,"Ok, but we should get back to business. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.","Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on.",Michael
5292,Pass.,I will go first. When I discovered,Michael
5293,What was the dilemma?,To tell you or not. And I’m glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.,Michael
5294,Oh— no no no.,"Yeah, . Come on, anybody. Let it fly.",Michael
5295,"Ok, once in a while I’ll take a long lunch.",A siesta!,Michael
5296,Never!,You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?,Michael
5297,Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.,Who hasn’t? Good. Good! What else?,Michael
5298,"No— I, I’d like to hear more about that.",Mmm…,Michael
5299,"I once reported Oscar to the INS. Turns out he’s clean, but I’m glad I did it.","Well, let’s keep this party movin’ on.",Michael
5300,"I’ll go. Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?",Bruuuuuuuuuce.,Michael
5301,Jackpot.,Ach! Wuh—,Michael
5302,"Exchange of steak. Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?","That’s crazy. That’s crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin’ with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got? You know what? That’s a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right… what is wrong. Who’s to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is… unknowable. But, let’s give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate.",Michael
5303,"Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.",Oh…,Michael
5304,"Liaisons, you mean meet-ups? I don’t know, once a month for six years. Something like that.","Meredith, why don’t you tell Holly… it’s not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened… and that you just like to sleep around.",Michael
5305,Am I in trouble here or something?,"No… no, this is just a stupid formality.",Michael
5306,One second.,"Well, well. Holly… lujah! It’s a miracle, you’re at your desk.",Michael
5307,It’s Mike-raculous.,"Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You’ll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there’s no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can’t, you know, just… sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.",Michael
5308,Sounds good.,Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?,Michael
5309,Oh I already bought this…,"Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady. Sorry! You know what? Let’s go out! Dunder Mifflin’s treat. Um, actually you’re not a client… so… we’ll just split it? Ethical.",Michael
5310,"So, I’ve gone over corporate policy.",What do you think? What do you think of this place?,Michael
5311,"Oh, it’s very nice.","Istn’t it? Yeah, it’s kind of… business/romantic. So you’re from Des Moines?",Michael
5312,Mmm.,"Wow, that sounds so… warm.",Michael
5313,In Summer.,Here too. You know what my favorite season is?,Michael
5314,Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.,"Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It’s just, I… I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.",Michael
5315,"Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don’t think there is any way I can write a report that doesn’t end with her being terminated.","Wow, terminator, terminator.",Michael
5316,I’m from da future.,Yeah.,Michael
5317,"Well, that’s very sweet but we have to follow the protocol. Those are the rules.","Ok, new idea. We don’t report it at all. We just punish her.",Michael
5318,We punish her?,"Mmhmm, tell her she can’t have sex for six months.",Michael
5319,I don’t think we could enforce that.,"I don’t know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.",Michael
5320,A chastity belt.,"No, it’s more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that… down… where you, where you put, where you put the…",Michael
5321,"No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.",Yes.,Michael
5322,What am I saying?,Well… bleh busted. I don’t…,Michael
5323,I’m saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don’t think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.,"Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.",Michael
5324,Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.,What’s the only thing worse than one HR rep?,Michael
5325,Two HR reps.,You get me.,Michael
5326,Can I sit?,"I don’t know. Can you? Kendall, my main man.",Michael
5327,"Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.",Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.,Michael
5328,Don’t sign anything.,"Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.",Michael
5329,It’s a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.,Get in there right now or I’m gonna lose it!,Michael
5330,Am I getting fired?,"Now is really not the time, Meredith.",Michael
5331,Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?,Let’s keep this rollin’… Ryan?,Michael
5332,"Hey, how did it go?","Oh, cr…, oh, God. Meredith, you know what? I just need a minute, okay?",Michael
5333,Okay.,What do you need?,Michael
5334,"I’m getting fired, aren’t I? I can’t get fired. I got nothing else. Nothing. No skill set. Can’t type, bad on the phone, not great with people.",I… really want to keep you.,Michael
5335,Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?,"Wait, what?",Michael
5336,I wish Toby was still here.,Nnnngah!,Michael
5337,Hey Michael?,Yeah.,Michael
5338,Contractions are coming every ten minutes.,"OK, just remember to keep breathing.",Michael
5339,My cervix is ripening.,"OK, good.",Michael
5340,Michael! My water’s breaking!,"Oh, OK! OK!",Michael
5341,Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?,I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.,Michael
5342,Right. Highways or surface roads?,I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.,Michael
5343,"No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!","I checked the route – there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby.",Michael
5344,It’s about adapting to the circumstances.,"Andy, would you like to have my baby?",Michael
5345,"No. OK, no. I’m crowning! I’m crowning! Aaaaaaaa!","All right, OK. Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go!",Michael

5348,Hold me!,I’m right here.,Michael
5349,Cradle my head!,"I’m right here, I’m right here.",Michael
5350,"I’m screaming, I’m screaming, I’m screaming! Aaaaaaaa!",All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.,Michael
5351,Numb me up. I want anesthesia!,"Shhh. No, you can’t have it. It’s too late.",Michael
5352,No! I don’t want natural!,No. You have to just push it out!,Michael
5353,OK!,Keep simulating.,Michael

5355,Do you have the Sharpie?!,Keep simulating.,Michael
5356,Do you have the Sharpie?!,"Yes, I do!",Michael
5357,"OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.",OK.,Michael
5358,Ready?!,Yes.,Michael
5359,Aaaaaaaa!,Aaaaaaaa! It’s coming! Here we go! Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?,Michael
5360,Butter. Newborns are slippery.,Nice touch. Good. Let’s try that again.,Michael
5361,No.,"Damnit, Phyllis! I’m sorry. Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?",Michael
5362,Michael wrote down “Astird.”,She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So…,Michael
5363,Ass…turd.,"I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this… Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I’m not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where’s my golden shower, Phyllis?",Michael
5364,"I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I’m no longer under Angela’s heel, and her little grape head is under mine.","Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don’t talk to them.",Michael
5365,Sorry.,"Make the party. Don’t – make the party, please, Phyllis. Pump it!",Michael
5366,Ahoy.,"Ahoy. So, how you doin’?",Michael
5367,Good.,"Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy – the child of which I have a vested interest. It’s all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly… fat and enormous right now – extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she’s here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I’m treating Ryan the same way.",Michael
5368,Astrid.,"Oh, OK. Why didn’t you call me?",Michael
5369,"Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-",I could have helped.,Michael
5370,"And the birth instructor thought it wasn’t a good idea for you to be there, so…","Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.",Michael
5371,"OK, you don’t have any idea what I’ve been through, so, let’s…","No, I don’t!",Michael

5386,"You’re sad about this. I know that, and I wish that I… but… would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?","Uh, yeah.",Michael
5387,"All right. Um, I’m just going to lie down for a couple of minutes. I’m exhausted, so um. Remind me to talk to you about Astrid’s 529. Wake me in twenty.","I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt… shortchanged.",Michael
5388,"I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt… shortchanged.",Phyllis? Could you take-.,Michael
5389,"What’s up, Mike?","Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.",Michael
5390,You a baby daddy?,"Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?",Michael
5391,Hell yeah. You know why? Because that was my baby.,I just saw this baby daddy-,Michael
5392,You should stop calling yourself “baby daddy.”,"Why, Darryl, because I’m quote white quote unquote?",Michael
5393,"Because you’re not a daddy, and it’s not your baby.",Well-,Michael
5394,You feel connected to his baby over there?,It’s- that’s different.,Michael

5396,"You want to hold me, to see how you feel?",Could I?,Michael
5397,"Michael, I need your help.","I was just going to… I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.",Michael
5398,"Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.","All right. All right, everybody, we’re leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving.",Michael
5399,"OK. You know what? There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.",OK?,Michael
5400,Don’t date Holly.,"Wha – that’s, I hate her. Wha – God! Why would you even ask me to – I, I mean, not that it matters, ’cause I don’t, but wha – OK, all right, fine.",Michael

5402,You still gonna be mean to me?,You wanna go out?,Michael
5403,"All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother’s belly is?",Oh! OK!,Michael
5404,"OK, you know what, I don’t think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I’m just going to get rid of all of that, so…",Seventeen. I say seventeen squares.,Michael

5438,"Move on, Michael.","Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let’s have an auction. Let’s do this. We’ll auction off people like in the olden days.",Michael
5439,"So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don’t want. Who would ever come to this?","I don’t know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be… a Bruce Springsteen fan – what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There’s a point there. But what is the point? I don’t understand what he’s saying.

5760,That was… I went to Costa Rica for a few months. What is going on?,"No, that was… that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate.",Michael
5761,Check this out.,Oh God!,Michael
5762,That is not mine. I have never seen that before.,"No, no no no no.",Michael
5763,What is going on here?,"God! No, that’s not… I don’t know what that is. And I… I bet he has nothing to do with that!",Michael
5764,Of course not!,"Ahh, that’s mine.",Michael
5765,"No! Michael, no!","Yes, it’s mine.",Michael
5766,"Yeah it’s, uh, a caprese salad. There’s a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there.",Are you kidding me? That’s my salad.,Michael
5767,You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don’t you use them?,You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.,Michael
5768,"I didn’t put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.",Hmm.,Michael
5769,Did you?,Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad… anywhere.,Michael
5770,"You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.","Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that’s who you’re worried about? You’re… you’re worried about the cop’s time? You think I framed you, and you’re worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.",Michael
5771,I did leave.,"Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of… history.",Michael
5772,"Well, I don’t see it that way.",Do you want to hear a lie?,Michael
5773,What?,I think you’re great. You’re my best friend.,Michael
5774,Here are our final actual costs for this year.,Mmm… okay.,Michael
5775,"As you can see, we did pretty well, so…","Yes. Yes, I can see… that we did indeed. Why don’t you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.",Michael
5776,"Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis…",Yes.,Michael
5777,Right there.,There’s the x-ax…icks.,Michael
5778,You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.,"Mmhmm, okay.",Michael
5779,But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year’s budget.,Why don’t you explain this to me like I’m five.,Michael
5780,Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.,Ho-oh!,Michael
5781,So you have an extra dollar.,Yeah.,Michael
5782,"So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer…",I’ll be six.,Michael
5783,"And you ask them for money, they’re gonna give you nine dollars. ‘Cause that’s what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.",So the dollar’s a surplus. This is a surplus.,Michael
5784,We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it’ll be deducted from next year’s budget.,Whoo.,Michael
5785,"We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.","Okay, break it down in terms of, um… okay, I-I think I’m getting you…",Michael
5786,New chairs?,"No, a new copier! Unless everybody can agree on something better?",Michael
5787,"Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.",So… we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?,Michael
5788,Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.,"Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let’s just decide and agree upon one.",Michael
5789,I’m with Pam. Chairs.,"Alright, so, teams forming.",Michael
5790,"We should really have the office’s air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.",You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.,Michael
5791,Michael?,Yes.,Michael
5792,"So Michael, what do you think?",Why me?,Michael
5793,You have to make the decision.,"Wow, okay. Well… I swallowed all your ideas, I’m going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.",Michael
5794,"Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?",Yes.,Michael
5795,Michael?,I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.,Michael
5796,I’m just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?,"Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.",Michael
5797,"Woah, you guys going to lunch?",Yes.,Michael
5798,Mind if I join?,"Ohh, God!",Michael
5799,All right.,Yeah!,Michael
5800,Let’s go.,Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!,Michael
5801,Let’s do it.,All right! Cool!,Michael
5802,Where we going?,I have no idea.,Michael
5803,"Michael, that is hilarious.","Oh, is somebody making fun of me?",Michael
5804,Thank you.,Yeah.,Michael
5805,Michael?,Yeah?,Michael
5806,Hey!,"Oh, hey.",Michael
5807,You got a second?,I do.,Michael
5808,"Oh, that must’ve been so fun.",it was fun. We had a good time.,Michael
5809,"Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?","Oh, thank you.",Michael
5810,"Yeah, is that a new tie?","Um, no, not… no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.",Michael
5811,That is amazing!,You think that’s good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.,Michael
5812,What?,Nine dollars. The boys’ department.,Michael
5813,No.,Look at the ass. Check out the ass.,Michael
5814,No way!,Look at that. Unh. Unh-unh.,Michael
5815,"Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.",Yes they were.,Michael
5816,Yeah.,They were.,Michael
5817,Here’s what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day…,Mmhmm.,Michael
5818,But not everyone…,Sits on a copier.,Michael
5819,Or even uses the copier every day.,Yeah.,Michael
5820,"Yeah, right?",Very valid.,Michael
5821,…That’s it.,All right.,Michael
5822,"All right, see you later…",See ya.,Michael
5823,Hot tie guy.,Hahaha!… well…,Michael
5824,"Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that’s okay.","Oh, thank you my dear.",Michael
5825,"Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.","Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay…",Michael
5826,There he is!,"There he is! Hello, hello!",Michael
5827,Hello.,Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.,Michael
5828,Oh!,Mm! Yeah!,Michael
5829,There’s that ass!,Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!,Michael
5830,"Woo! Yeah. Aw, don’t take it away!","Oh… ah, I almost choked.",Michael
5831,Did somebody call Hank?,"Hank, thank God you’re here. The office is at a crossroads.",Michael
5832,"So, there’s no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.","Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. Yeah, take as many as you want.",Michael
5833,"Thank you. Thank you. You know, it’s nice and warm up here.",Yes.,Michael
5834,So what are we talking about?,"Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-",Michael
5835,I know what a surplus is.,"Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here’s the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.",Michael
5836,Is that the copier?,"It is, yes.",Michael
5837,Hmm.,What?,Michael
5838,I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.,Okay.,Michael
5839,You can try mine.,"Oh, there we go.",Michael
5840,"Hmm, not much lumbar support.","Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.",Michael
5841,"On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.","So, the copier.",Michael
5842,"Well, let me finish.","All right, yes.",Michael
5843,Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.,"Well, what should I do?",Michael
5844,…Let me see the copier again.,"All right, get out. Get out.",Michael
5845,Michael.,Hey David- I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I’m stopping now.,Michael
5846,Is this why you’re calling me?,"No, no, no, no, no. No. I’m calling- I’m sorry.",Michael
5847,Okay.,"Mm. I’m calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.",Michael
5848,You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?,"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I’m not the bad guy.",Michael
5849,"Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.",The what now?,Michael
5850,Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.,…Like a tip? $645?!,Michael
5851,"We have that going out Tuesday… Okay? Sure, no, I can… I’ll double-check that for you.","All right, attention everyone.",Michael
5852,Let me call you right back. Okay.,I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier… is… working perfectly.,Michael
5853,That’s the original.,"Pam, would you stand up for a sec? Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct… it’s a good chair. I think we’re spoiled because we don’t appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers? They don’t have copiers. They don’t even- Gah! They don’t even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.",Michael
5854,Do you know?,Do I know what?,Michael
5855,I think you know.,"Mm, no…",Michael
5856,Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?,$645.,Michael
5857,Michael’s a genius.,Right.,Michael
5858,Why’d you say dollars?,Because that is how my mind works.,Michael
5859,"Hey Michael, what’s 394 times 5,912?",Let’s see…,Michael
5860,You’re gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?,"I don’t need $645; I already have $645, more or less.",Michael
5861,You’re gonna get us a copier then?,This is so stupid.,Michael
5862,Or chairs?,"This is so, so stupid. And, God… that’s my phone.",Michael
5863,I didn’t hear a phone.,To be continued!,Michael
5864,You are a smart guy. I know you’ll do the right thing.,You think it’s easy?,Michael
5865,It’s your job.,"Okay, you know what? Why don’t you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I’m taking the bonus. All right?",Michael
5866,"Hey, we’re going with the chairs.",What?,Michael
5867,Thanks Michael.,Good work. I’m proud of you. Mother-,Michael
5868,Yes.,Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.,Michael
5869,Yes.,"Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out.",Michael
5870,They are now.,Cool. My horn can pierce the sky.,Michael
5871,Oh… my… GOD!!! Hit me again.,Alright… One more time around the block.,Michael
5872,What is it?,That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice…ka.,Michael
5873,"Wow, that is delicious.",Yeah.,Michael
5874,Can’t believe no ones thought of that.,I know.,Michael
5875,"We’re back on the 5th, should we just do it then?","Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",Michael
5876,Ah… would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,"No, no. I celebrate privately.",Michael
5877,That’s cool.,Why don’t we just do it now? We’ll do it quickly.,Michael
5878,Now? It’s our Christmas party.,We’ll do it quickly.,Michael
5879,Well what if we can’t do it quickly.,What if we can’t do it quickly? What if we cant do it–,Michael
5880,Do you know how to do an intervention?,"Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.",Michael
5881,A little better. I threw up.,Uck… T.M.I.,Michael
5882,Yeah.,"Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.",Michael
5883,"Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith’s work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.",I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.,Michael
5884,I’m not an alcoholic.,"Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.",Michael
5885,Aye.,The aye’s have it.,Michael
5886,I don’t care what everyone thinks. I know I am not an alcoholic.,"Alright, well, let’s look at this a little bit closer then shall we?",Michael
5887,Sure.,Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?,Michael
5888,Obviously.,Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,Michael
5889,Where did you get this?,"I got it on a website, that’s not important.",Michael
5890,"Michael, We should contact some experts. You don’t know what your doing.","Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I’m doing your job man. Hey, are you texting?",Michael
5891,"Yeah, ’cause this is kind of a drag.","Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here’s what I’d like to do. I’d like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I’ll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That’s how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith’s drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don’t say anything she’s not going to get any better. Yes, Kevin.",Michael
5892,"Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me. And that was really cool.",That’s– you didn’t– you weren’t hurt by that.,Michael
5893,You’re welcome.,"Okay, no, that’s not what we’re going for. Who has a problem with Meredith’s drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don’t you have anything?",Michael
5894,I am fine.,"Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey– come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",Michael
5895,I know I drink. I like to party,I want you to say I’m an alcoholic.,Michael
5896,I am not an alcoholic!,"You can say it as loudly as you want, but we’re not going to believe you.",Michael
5897,I don’t mind telling you that I have an addiction. I do. To porn.,"Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you’re dead?",Michael
5898,"Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.",Dwight–,Michael
5899,She is a hazard to the other people of the office.,…okay.,Michael
5900,"Michael, I think… you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.","Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It’s Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.",Michael
5901,We just missed Poor Richards.,We did?,Michael
5902,"Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?","Oh, shoot. Oh well, we’ll have to go someplace else then I guess.",Michael
5903,"The Bog? Cooper’s, Kelly’s…","We could go there, sure.",Michael
5904,"…Brixx’s, Carmen’s…","Yes, yes.",Michael
5905,"…The Fort, Andy Gavin’s.",I have a new place.,Michael
5906,"Well, it must have just opened up.","It– yep, recently.",Michael
5907,Yeah… all right.,All right.,Michael
5908,Enough of this Christmas crap. Let’s get some party music. Yeah!,"Yeah, oh there you go.",Michael
5909,Yeah!,That’s good.,Michael
5910,Yeah that’s better.,We’re party girls.,Michael
5911,Sunrise Rehab? No! No! No! I told you no! There is no way!,It’s okay. It’s all right.,Michael
5912,No way! There is no way! No way!,"Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on–",Michael
5913,No way! No way! There is no way!,Here we go. This is gonna be good.,Michael
5914,No! No way! I told you. We talked about this. There is absolutely no way. No! No! There is no way! No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!,Yes you are.,Michael
5915,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!,Shhh… just calm down.,Michael
5916,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! No! No!,Come on. Shh…,Michael
5917,No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!,Here’s the door. Here’s the door.,Michael
5918,There is no way! There is no way! No! No!,Let’s start meeting– Hello. How are you?,Michael
5919,Can I help you?,I have a deposit. Alcoholic.,Michael
5920,No! No! No! No! No!,So do I sign?,Michael
5921,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I’m sorry, he’s not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?","Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!",Michael
5922,Yes!,"No. No, no. There was wind.",Michael
5923,I was just jogging.,"Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.",Michael
5924,"No, no, no, it’s not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.",I want another try. Here we go! Thirty-one! Thirty-one!,Michael
5925,There was a car.,I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.,Michael
5926,Thirty-one is humanly impossible.,"Go, Oscar. Thirty-one’s my number.",Michael
5927,That’s impossible.,Beat it!,Michael
5928,"Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It’s kind of the elephant in the room, so I’ll just… No one has RSVP’ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.","Wait, you still don’t know…",Michael
5929,Nothing.,You still don’t know.,Michael
5930,Why don’t… Let’s…,What are you doing?,Michael
5931,How about we just… Just have to talk to you for a second…,Andy.,Michael
5932,"No, no one has RSVP’ed, and I don’t understand it, and now, you’re shutting me out. You’re not even listening. That’s really considerate. Thank you.","No, what I’m saying is…",Michael
5933,"No, no.","No, that’s not it.",Michael
5934,We can’t figure that out.,I can’t take it anymore.,Michael
5935,"Wait, what? You can’t take what?",I am telling Andy.,Michael
5936,No. You can’t do that. It shouldn’t come from you.,"Who should it come from, then?",Michael
5937,Angela.,Are you still having intercourse with her?,Michael
5938,What is wrong with you? She is engaged.,Did you ever have intercourse in this office?,Michael
5939,When what? When what?,You know this can’t go on.,Michael
5940,What can’t go on?,We have to put an end to this.,Michael
5941,Seems like…,Come on.,Michael
5942,Angela said she was going to tell him. She’s just not ready.,When will she be ready?,Michael
5943,I don’t know.,Is she crazy in bed?,Michael
5944,Stop. What?,"How so, specifically?",Michael
5945,And!,Really?,Michael
5946,This shouldn’t be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.,It’s too late.,Michael
5947,"Well it’s not too late, because you haven’t done anything.",I am already walking.,Michael
5948,"Michael, once this gets out… I don’t know how it’s going to go down.","Okay, what does that mean?",Michael
5949,Might get ugly.,"Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.",Michael
5950,Have a good trip.,Thanks. Andy?,Michael
5951,Yeah.,Walk with me.,Michael
5952,You’re not making any sense.,"Well… no, I’m not. So I… I’m not very articulate today, so I’ll just leave it for another time. Another day.",Michael
5953,All righty.,Which will be fine. I am off!,Michael
5954,Have a good meeting!,Thank you!,Michael
5955,Kick Wallace’s ass!,"Okay. I will… Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so…",Michael
5956,I can’t hear you through the glass,Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They’ve been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.,Michael
5957,What?,All right. See you later. Ahh.,Michael
5958,Are you serious?,Yep.,Michael
5959,"So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don’t know exactly how to put this, but… what are you doing right?",Right what?,Michael
5960,"Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. Look, you’re not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing… is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.","David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don’t ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter… where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or… or where you’ve been… ever. For any reason, whatsoever.",Michael
5961,"Here’s the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It’s not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It’s Hail Mary time.","Hey, what say we order up some pasta?",Michael
5962,"It’s hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. And thanks for coming in.","Oh, thank you.",Michael
5963,Yes.,"I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.",Michael
5964,Yeah.,Okay.,Michael
5965,Hi Michael how are you?,"Hi, I am well, how are you?",Michael
5966,"So listen, as you know, we haven’t yet filled the regional supervisor job.","Oh, have you not?",Michael
5967,"Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor . There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.",Yeah.,Michael
5968,"There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can’t get a report on it because it’s not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.",Okay.,Michael
5969,I’ll fax over some of the things we’re looking for.,"Fax, why don’t you just send it over on a dinosaur?",Michael
5970,"Look, this is important, Michael.","Oh, well, then, email it to me.",Michael
5971,What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?,I will seduce her.,Michael
5972,"No, I wanna seduce her.","No, I will seduce her.",Michael
5973,"Please Michael, please.","No, I got it.",Michael
5974,You’ll fall in love with her.,"Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.",Michael
5975,"Okay, let’s go over the plan again.","Alright, I am a local business owner. I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies",Michael
5976,Your fictitious name?,Michael Scarn.,Michael
5977,I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.,Okay.,Michael
5978,Then we meet at the Denny’s…,No.,Michael
5979,…and then we compare notes.,"No, no, I never said Denny’s. IHOP.",Michael
5980,You know how I feel about IHOP.,"Oh, don’t start,",Michael
5981,Are you socialist?,You know what? I don’t want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.,Michael
5982,I’ll have a cup of a coffee.,You will have pancakes and you’ll like it.,Michael
5983,Store only has three employees.,So what?,Michael
5984,It means they are not expanding.,Maybe they are shrinking.,Michael
5985,No.,They could be shrinking.,Michael
5986,No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.,Ah ha Yup.,Michael
5987,"Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.",Mm hmm .,Michael
5988,Which Means they’re not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.,"And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.",Michael
5989,"Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.","Argh, why are you all…",Michael
5990,Get your clouds right.,Shut up.,Michael
5991,"So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. No, no like this. Good.",Ready to do this?,Michael
5992,Yeah.,Good. Here come the sharks.,Michael
5993,"Hello, hi.",My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.,Michael
5994,"Oh, please come in",Thank you.,Michael
5995,What kind of business are you in.,We are a law firm.,Michael
5996,"I assume your primary paper needs are stationary, general office.","You know, I will be honest with you… about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn’t feel like a priority. So I guess my question for you would be how many clients do you have?",Michael
5997,About 80.,Really? That many? This doesn’t seem like a very big operation.,Michael
5998,"It’s just me, my wife and my son.","Ah, so when did you set up shop?",Michael

6455,"Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research, financials?","No, no no.",Michael
6456,"You need those things. Most new businesses, they don’t make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don’t cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?",Okay.,Michael

6653,"Michael, good to see you.","Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I’m closing the door.",Michael

6655,"Dwight, I’m in a meeting.",That’s very rude.,Michael
6656,"La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!","I’m going to pull a date out of the air right now.

6673,Okay.,Explain that.,Michael
6674,"As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care…","Well, we don’t–",Michael
6675,…business expansion–,"Whatever, yeah.",Michael
6676,"At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you’ll make.",Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.,Michael
6677,They’re actually putting you out of business.,"Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.",Michael
6678,It’s a program. There’s no such thing–,Just crunch ’em. Just crunch ’em please.,Michael
6679,"Steve Martin’s not dead, Michael.",I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It’s this.,Michael
6680,You want to hear something sad?,I would love that.,Michael
6681,I went to Fort Lauderdale.,Was it nice?,Michael
6682,"Yeah, it was amazing. There was a great Pad Thai place, though.",I love Pad Thai.,Michael
6683,You’ve never had Pad Thai.,No. There’s a lot I haven’t done.,Michael
6684,"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?","We’re not hiring, Jim.",Michael
6685,Actually here for something else.,"Listen, I can’t make you laugh right now.",Michael
6686,"He’s bluffing, Pam.","Jim, what you don’t understand is that this company’s worthl–",Michael
6687,Oh!,No– We don’t have–,Michael
6688,Oh! See I’m here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.,Uh… Yes.,Michael
6689,Three yeses. I will see you titans of industry upstairs.,"Yes, well, we’re not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.",Michael
6690,Missed the last part.,That’s a pun.,Michael
6691,Got it.,Yep. Oh… wow.,Michael
6692,"Okay, so you are not going to reveal in any way that we’re broke.",Of course not.,Michael
6693,That we’re having any problem at all.,"Nope, nope, nope.",Michael
6694,"Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.","Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we’re broke.",Michael
6695,"No, Michael.",Ah…,Michael
6696,We have to come from a position of strength.,"I’m good, I’m good.",Michael
6697,Just put it out of your mind.,It is. I’m good.,Michael
6698,Hi.,"Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we’re expected. Well, well, well. How the turntables…",Michael
6699,"Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.",And we are prepared to reject that offer.,Michael
6700,"Michael, you haven’t even heard–",Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer?,Michael
6701,"$12,000.",Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don’t even want to hear what your first offer was.,Michael
6702,"Here’s the situation. Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you can’t be making very much money. I don’t know how your prices are so low, but I know it can’t keep up that way. I’m sure you’re scared. Probably in debt. This is the best offer you’re gonna get.",I’ll see your situation and I’ll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you’re going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don’t think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.,Michael
6703,"Okay, now I don’t know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How’s about $60,000. Hmm? $60,0000. Michael?",We’ll have to talk–,Michael
6704,Mm-hmm.,Just amongst ourselves.,Michael
6705,"Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside. Take your time.","Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",Michael
6706,"$60,000.",We are so rich.,Michael
6707,"So you’ve thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer. We can finally put this whole thing behind us? Hmm?",No.,Michael
6708,Why are you assuming you’d get the whole thing?,"It’s a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn’t you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?",Michael
6709,"No, Michael’s right. Jobs are safer.",Agreed?,Michael
6710,"Yeah, discuss these things–","Shut up, shut up. Hello?",Michael
6711,They don’t make them anymore.,And I want Charles gone.,Michael
6712,"That’s very kind of you to say, David.",I need him gone.,Michael
6713,No.,"Okay, then I want Pam back.",Michael
6714,"Uh, you already have a new receptionist–",Sales.,Michael
6715,Pam’s not a salesperson.,"Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it’s heyday.",Michael
6716,Okay. Please continue.,And Ryan.,Michael
6717,"Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael. Ryan is–","You know, David. I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.",Michael
6718,Do you realize what you’re asking for here? You’re talking about salary plus health benefits–,And dental this time.,Michael
6719,"Insurance, taxes, social security for three people. This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand. You’re talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.",These are our demands.,Michael
6720,Your company cannot be worth that much.,"Our company is worth nothing. That’s the difference between you and I. Business isn’t about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names.",Michael
6721,Michael–,That’s one of ’em! Yes. These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court.,Michael
6722,Okay. Deal. Okay?,Can we have the room please?,Michael
6723,Alright!,Yes! Can you believe it? That’s what I’m talking about!,Michael
6724,"Hey, guys–","No, no. You’re done.",Michael
6725,Who is it?,"It’s Michael Scott. Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes.",Michael
6726,Wh–what are you doing?,"If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.",Michael
6727,Okay.,Yes.,Michael
6728,People are dressed inappropriately.,"Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different.",Michael
6729,Nothing. I didn’t say anything.,All right.,Michael
6730,Do I still have a job here?,"Not important. Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.",Michael
6731,How is that going to work?,"It’s going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and–",Michael
6732,"Yeah , aren’t we getting those clients back?","No, you lost those clients.",Michael
6733,"I call foul, sir.",Okay.,Michael
6734,You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.,"Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It’s a trash can.",Michael
6735,"Oh, thanks, man.",Pamela.,Michael
6736,"Thank, Michael.",Yep.,Michael
6737,That one’s great.,I know.,Michael
6738,You look so classy in that picture.,I do? Well–Where is that bowl?,Michael
6739,"Hey, you have a second?",Michael Scott Paper Company only.,Michael
6740,"Yeah, I think you’re going to want to cool it with that ’cause it’s starting to upset the other salesmen.","Okay, well—",Michael
6741,Tough.,"I will–no, no. I’ll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.",Michael
6742,"This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be–but definitely is–a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now.",Against who?,Michael
6743,Mm-hmmm.,"That was us, right there.",Michael
6744,What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.,Mm-hmm.,Michael
6745,Chiklis style.,"Yeah, the Commish.",Michael
6746,"Yes, but Chiklis Shield style. Not Commish style.","Yeah, yeah. The Shield.",Michael
6747,Lunch.,Where’d you eat?,Michael
6748,A restaurant.,"What’d you have, Stanley?",Michael
6749,I had Mexican food.,"So since you guys already ate, you won’t be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you? Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon.",Michael
6750,That looks great.,"Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry?",Michael
6751,I can eat.,I’m going to o have some of this meat sandwich.,Michael
6752,It’s pony.,Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?,Michael
6753,Dijonnaise.,"Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys.",Michael
6754,And you’re a temp and I’m taking your phone. I’m confiscating this.,"Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.",Michael
6755,"We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.",Who quits?,Michael
6756,Me too.,You guys gotta be kidding.,Michael
6757,"No, we gotta be deadly serious. We’ll start our own paper company. The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance…Stanley Paper Company.","I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I’m going to give you some seed money. There you go. There’s some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one.",Michael
6758,You want us to apologize to you?,Yes I do.,Michael
6759,That’s completely backwards.,It’s frontward’s.,Michael
6760,Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?,Whatever you guys did earlier.,Michael
6761,I don’t know that first things about secret meetings.,"Just do it, okay?",Michael
6762,I’ll do–,Get ’em there. Get ’em there.,Michael
6763,I’ll do the best I can.,Are you kidding me?,Michael
6764,Deceit does not come easy to me.,"Okay, okay, okay.",Michael
6765,Are you giving us our clients back?,"If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, “apology accepted”, I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you–complimentary white chocolate bark.",Michael
6766,Nobody likes that stuff except for you.,They wouldn’t make it unless people liked it.,Michael
6767,"Michael, just give us our clients back. That’s all we care about.","Okay. If I give you your clients back there won’t be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.",Michael
6768,So?,"Fine, have your clients. I can see that’s what you wanted all along. However, I rescind my apology.",Michael
6769,That’s fair.,You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.,Michael
6770,I don’t know.,Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?,Michael
6771,Sure. Let me just finish this turn.,And Bingo was his name. Let’s go.,Michael
6772,"I don’t want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan. You know that.",You’re close with Pam too.,Michael
6773,"Eh, she’s nice, I guess. You know what? Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.","Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he’s my number one choice.",Michael
6774,"Well, that’s–",I like his hair.,Michael
6775,"Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale.",Okay.,Michael
6776,He definitely stole my iPod.,That sounds pretty biased.,Michael
6777,You didn’t hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious ’cause his mom drives him to work everyday.,"Okay. Pam, pros.",Michael
6778,Mm-hmm.,"I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn’t always follow through. Sh–New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice.",Michael
6779,That’s not true.,I don’t need to tell you that.,Michael
6780,I think she’d be a really good salesperson.,"I don’t think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven’t said one bad thing about Pam.",Michael
6781,And I won’t.,"Okay. So be it, then you’ve lost credibility. And I’m going to go with my guy, and that’s Ryan.",Michael
6782,"All right. You’re right, sometimes when she’s tired, she can be a little bit shrill. But that’s not a weird voice.","Oh, wow! Whoa!",Michael
6783,Take it easy.,"Ho-ho, man! Wow. Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. ‘Cause I’m not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba–",Michael
6784,Just tell me.,I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren’t enough clients for the two of you. So I had to–,Michael
6785,"No, okay.","I’m sorry, sorry.",Michael
6786,"Okay, I get it. Why are you giggling? Is this a joke? Michael, is this– did I get the job?","Yes, you did.",Michael

6793,Yeah. ‘Cause you said I didn’t,"Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.",Michael
6794,What about Ryan?,"I don’t know, I offered him his temp job back. We’ll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn’t get the job, so–",Michael

6905,"What about the fact that they’re here today? What about that? That didn’t throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, “oh, this would be really funny.”",Thank you.,Michael

6913,Okay. So good to see you.,Good to see you. AJ.,Michael
6914,Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera!,"Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.",Michael
6915,"Here it is, here it is… truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.",Yeah! Gainer! Woohoo!,Michael
6916,Hardcore Parkour!,Parkoooooour!,Michael
6917,...,...,Michael
6918,"If they get married before I do, I’m going to kill myself.",Who’s getting married?,Michael
6919,Nobody.,"If somebody doesn’t tell me, I’m gonna start screaming.",Michael
6920,It’s Eric and Megan.,"Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.",Michael
6921,They’re not getting married. It’s just talk.,Did everybody know about this but me?,Michael
6922,"There’s nothing to know, it’s just gossip.",Okay… okay.,Michael
6923,"Okay, let me finish this thought.",Eric likes Megan.,Michael
6924,He most definitely does. He’s been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.,How do you know this?,Michael
6925,What are you talking about?,I’m talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.,Michael
6926,At Tink’s?,Yes,Michael
6927,How’d you know about that?,Well…,Michael
6928,Did Stanley tell you?,Stanley was on your group date?,Michael
6929,"No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn’t wave back.",Does anybody else know about this?,Michael
6930,No.,...,Michael
6931,There he goes. There he goes.,"So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?",Michael
6932,...,Nothing? Well I got a little somethin’ somethin’. I don’t know if I should say…,Michael
6933,Just keep it to yourself then.,Stanly is having a midlife crisis.,Michael
6934,Stanley’s way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.,"Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.",Michael
6935,"Teri’s out of town, Michael.",Who?,Michael
6936,"Teri, Stanley’s wife. She’s at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.",...,Michael
6937,What are you talking about?,Stanley’s wife is out of town.,Michael
6938,He was definitely with somebody.,"Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?",Michael
6939,...,I don’t get it!,Michael
6940,"If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal.",Drugs?,Michael
6941,Making out.,Mmm… okay. Uhh… hmm… okay. Never mind. Carry on.,Michael
6942,Q.,"No… no. He’s holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What’s that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven’t you guessed?",Michael
6943,T.,"T! Yes! Yes! That is a “T”, and there’s another one right there. Just sound that out. You’re almost there.",Michael
6944,I’m meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?,"No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I’m casting a movie and I’m looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?",Michael
6945,Goodbye.,Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.,Michael
6946,You have to stop this.,Did you hear Stanley’s having an affair?,Michael
6947,I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.,"Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it’s really sad because everybody thinks you’re a loser…",Michael
6948,Do you know if it’s true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.,...,Michael
6949,"That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?","So It’s not true. Okay, well… ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just… racial profiling gossip.",Michael
6950,Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.,So stupid!,Michael
6951,It’s just that… Teri’s been traveling a lot…,"I know, I know.",Michael
6952,And it’s been lonely.,"Oh, I bet.",Michael
6953,"Cynthia’s been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill… I didn’t…","Wait, hold, hold, hold… so it IS true?",Michael
6954,"Yeah, but Michael, I’m going to go break it off. That’s where I’m headed right now. I swear.","Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they’re going on sales calls and then go someplace else? ‘Cause that’s not cool.",Michael
6955,"I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.",I’m not saying… a damn thing.,Michael
6956,"I’m counting on you, Michael.",You can count on me.,Michael
6957,"I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.",Did you hear about Angela? That’s pretty weird.,Michael
6958,Yeah… what do you mean exactly?,"Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno’s on the turnpike.",Michael
6959,Reeeeally.,Uh huh. Alright?,Michael
6960,Kelly has an eating disorder?,Yeah.,Michael
6961,She always eats my lunch.,Anorexia. She’s an anorexatic.,Michael
6962,We should do something.,"Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.",Michael
6963,Really?,Yeah. So… and Andy is gay.,Michael
6964,Andy Bernard??,Mm hmm.,Michael
6965,Mm hmm.,Did you hear Pam is pregnant?,Michael
6966,Really?,Yeah!,Michael
6967,"A few months, that’s why they’re rushing the wedding.","Guys, guys… you can’t believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It’s just… there’s no stalking it. It’s a weird day for false facts. Let it go.",Michael
6968,"Guys, guys… you can’t believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It’s just… there’s no stalking it. It’s a weird day for false facts. Let it go.","Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff… who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.",Michael
6969,Yes.,"Yeah, yeah… you know what? Let’s discredit these rumors.",Michael
6970,"Yeah, sure, but… who’s been saying all that stuff?","That’s not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn’t listen to any of that crap.",Michael
6971,I heard it from Michael.,...,Michael
6972,Where are you going?,Nowhere.,Michael
6973,"Come on, boss.",...,Michael
6974,Even the fact that I’m gay?,Yes.,Michael
6975,Yes!,"But guys, I’m a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I’m a J. Crew model.",Michael
6976,No. We heard that about Jim.,"Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.",Michael
6977,How is that a bad rumor?,"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they’re very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It’s set our industry back quite a bit.",Michael
6978,You told everyone I was having an affair?,"Okay, okay… here’s the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn’t want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.",Michael
6979,Michael… am I gay?,"The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person’s life, is that…",Michael
6980,Stop. Don’t. Just…,"Alright, alright… you know, this is not the truth, and you can’t fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.",Michael
6981,Nope.,Yes. Jim…,Michael
6982,It’s true!,Look at that! That is the inside of your vagina!,Michael
6983,...,A week? A month? A year?,Michael
6984,"Michael, we only told our parents last week.",Did you pee on a stick?,Michael
6985,I did. It was inconclusive.,You should’ve told me.,Michael
6986,You’re right. We should’ve realized that you are an equal part of this.,...,Michael
6987,"Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.",...,Michael
6988,You called Stanley’s wife?,"Oh, oh… yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh… oh God.",Michael
6989,Don’t take it.,"No, I have to take it, or it’ll seem suspicious.",Michael
6990,"If you talk to her, you’re gonna tell her about Stanley, and that’s gonna seem more suspicious.","No, no, I can do this.",Michael
6991,You can’t do this.,"Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won’t talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.",Michael
6992,"Michael, please don’t.","Hey, what up, Cynthia?",Michael
6993,...,"Hold on a second, Cynthia.",Michael
6994,You wanted to see me?,"Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.",Michael
6995,Yeah sure.,I’m going in for a procedure today.,Michael
6996,Is everything okay?,"Yeah, it’s routine. I’m just a little bit scared.",Michael
6997,"I’m sure everything will be fine. What do you? What’s the procedure, if you don’t mind my asking?",It is a colonoscopy.,Michael
6998,Okay.,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?",Michael
6999,Oh my God.,"My main concern, should I have a safe word?",Michael
7000,"So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?","Abso… you know what? I’ll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.",Michael
7001,"Okay, I will look at it Monday.","Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I’m gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you’ll get it Weds.",Michael
7002,"Hey, Good luck.","Oh right, this thing. I remember now. What’s this about?",Michael
7003,"Ah, this is just me and David, if that’s okay.",It’s okay with me but he’s gonna want me in there.,Michael
7004,"No, ah it’s okay Michael. We got it.",Really?,Michael
7005,Yeah.,"Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I’m gonna blow my brains out.",Michael
7006,"Okay, it’s just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.","You and Jim are close, huh?",Michael
7007,"Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.","Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you…",Michael
7008,"Ummm, I don’t know.","Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.",Michael
7009,"Did I? Doesn’t sound like me, not very superstitious.","If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That’s how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk.",Michael
7010,Please don’t talk about my breast milk.,I just don’t want you to lie to me. I don’t want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you?,Michael
7011,Yeah.,I just don’t want you to.,Michael
7012,Who was that?,Sorry about that. What’d I miss?,Michael
7013,"Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don’t mind.","Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don’t. Yes, I do! No, I don’t mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this… call waiting. Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.",Michael
7014,They’ve been in there a while.,Yeah.,Michael
7015,Can’t be good.,Nope.,Michael
7016,Think they’re talking about me?,"No, I think they’re talking about me.",Michael
7017,What can I do for ya Hoss?,How are your sales doin’?,Michael
7018,"Oh, I’m sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay. “Hey Andy let’s go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.”","Shhh, I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on in that room, okay?",Michael
7019,I think he’s around here…,"Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin’?",Michael
7020,"Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?","Yes, definitely.",Michael
7021,Are you sure you’re okay with these new responsibilites?,Look who you’re talking to.,Michael
7022,I’m just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone’s talents.,"Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.",Michael
7023,What about Jim? Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?,Permission to speak on the record?,Michael
7024,Please do.,"Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don’t think so. Because Big Bird doesn’t make the tough decisions. I… If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.",Michael
7025,I thought you liked Jim?,"Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it’s his performance report… right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.",Michael
7026,"“Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.”","It’s not very well written, but you get the gist.",Michael
7027,Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?,I can just continue to run it myself.,Michael
7028,Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.,This was Jim’s idea?,Michael
7029,Mmhmm.,"Wow. Ummm, well I’d have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.",Michael
7030,"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?",Well we did talk about how handsome you are.,Michael
7031,Why don’t we head in your office to talk?,"Oh what a week, God. We said… I know there were certain things we said…",Michael
7032,"Michael, look I’ll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.","Hmmm, that’s weird, that’s weird… it’s kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln’s secretary was named Kennedy.",Michael
7033,"Michael, did you say anything?","Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.",Michael
7034,Really?,Yes!,Michael
7035,You will? Wanna do it right now?,Yes.,Michael
7036,This is David.,"Hey David, this is Michael Scott. Michael Scott here.",Michael
7037,Yep.,Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.,Michael
7038,"So, what, you’re changing your mind about Jim?","Absolutely, not. Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.",Michael
7039,"Michael, it seems like you’re cutting in and out… This is not what you said earlier.","Wha… here’s the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.",Michael
7040,"Well, it doesn’t change what you showed me in Jim’s file.","Well, nnnn, that… that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.",Michael
7041,How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.,"I never recommended you because I didn’t want to lose you and I didn’t want to lose Pam, and now I don’t wanna lose the baby.",Michael
7042,"So instead, you screwed me?",That’s what she…,Michael
7043,David Wallace is calling.,Kind of in the middle of something here.,Michael
7044,Should I tell him you’ll call him back?,"I, yeah… no, I’ll tell him myself. Let’s both.",Michael
7045,"Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?","No, it’s just us.",Michael
7046,"Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.","Oh, oh, well here he is right now. Come in.",Michael
7047,"Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone’s on board.",Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.,Michael
7048,"Wow, that sounds pretty cool.","I like that, so manager and co-manager.",Michael
7049,"Co-manager and Co-manager. See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.",Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.,Michael
7050,"Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed…","Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make… whoa do you have an announcement?",Michael
7051,I’m… I was making it.,"Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.",Michael
7052,Co-manager of what?,"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.",Michael
7053,What’s happening to you Michael?,"What’s happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome.",Michael
7054,Could you please sign my expense report?,"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim’s now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.",Michael
7055,I have a complaint about Jim.,That is not big picture.,Michael
7056,"I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.",… Okay.,Michael
7057,Jim won’t sign my expense report.,That is not– okay– that is day-to-day.,Michael
7058,"No, that is huge.",You’re trying to trick me.,Michael
7059,This has to do–,"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",Michael
7060,Michael…,Yes?,Michael
7061,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",Michael
7062,I have noticed that we–,Welcome.,Michael
7063,Thank you. I’ve noticed we’ve been having a lot of conference room meetings.,Mm-hmm.,Michael
7064,"And I’m wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um–",Disruptive.,Michael
7065,Yes.,"No, I don’t think they are. I think the meetings are very important.",Michael
7066,"Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.",Let’s do.,Michael
7067,"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.","N– well, to be fair, Jim… James… Jimothy… To be fair, Jimothy, the– ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",Michael
7068,I am.,"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn’t about planets…",Michael
7069,Right.,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",Michael
7070,"Yes, I agree.","Because it’s a big universe, and we’re all just little, tiny specks of dust.",Michael
7071,I just think that maybe they’re eating large amounts of the day.,"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it’s light out, you wake up, it’s dark. That’s the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",Michael
7072,You mean on a weekend?,Yes.,Michael
7073,How about this? I think our goal should be we don’t have meetings unless they’re absolutely essential.,Alright. No more meetings this week.,Michael
7074,Really? You just agreed to that?,I can be very suprising.,Michael
7075,"Okay, I thought I saw people missing.","Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",Michael
7076,"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?","Stanley, you don’t need to answer that.",Michael
7077,"Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people’s time with meetings like these.",What do you mean by “these people”?,Michael
7078,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting.","Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",Michael
7079,That’s not what I meant.,"Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",Michael
7080,I disagree.,What do you guys think?,Michael
7081,"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?","No, no, no, you don’t need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.",Michael
7082,"That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",That is not what Wallace told us.,Michael
7083,That’s exactly what Wallace told us.,That is not the way I heard it.,Michael
7084,"I’m not bossing you around. I’m trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.","No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. I will call David Wallace.",Michael
7085,David Wallace is on line two for you guys.,Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don’t we just–,Michael
7086,"Hey, David. You got Jim here.","Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.",Michael
7087,"Hey guys, um, I’m calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we’re leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.","Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.",Michael
7088,It’s probably a little of both.,Which is it more of?,Michael
7089,"Wait, I’m sorry. Michael, are you– are you texting me?",I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.,Michael
7090,"Nope, not at all.","No, it will not be. I am on top of it.",Michael
7091,"Alright, thanks alot, David.","Talk to you later– Okay, you didn’t let me say good-bye. Alright, I am looking forward to this.",Michael
7092,You don’t have to lie.,"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don’t see you anymore.",Michael
7093,Right.,All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,Michael
7094,"Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?","No, we can do it during the day. It doesn’t have to be that dramatic, Jim.",Michael
7095,Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.,"Jim, don’t take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",Michael
7096,It’s hard to tell so far.,You use your brain too much.,Michael
7097,"I’m sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",Sometimes the smartest people don’t think at all.,Michael
7098,You just came up with that.,As I was saying it.,Michael
7099,"Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro– everyone gets a little bit.",Con– you look like a nerd.,Michael
7100,Con– no one gets as much as they did last year.,Pro– you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.,Michael
7101,Pro– no favoritism.,"Con– you unzip your pants, and you find that there’s a calculator down there.",Michael
7102,"You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.",That will not go over well.,Michael
7103,"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. ‘Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us…","Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I’m gonna kill myself.",Michael
7104,I’m not gonna let you stop me from thinking.,"No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.",Michael
7105,Michael.,And then another–,Michael
7106,"Look, you have a lot of strengths.","Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.",Michael
7107,I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.,Ha! That– I am not known for that!,Michael
7108,But there is a reason why I’m here!,Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!,Michael
7109,"No, it’s because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!","Okay. Well, why don’t you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don’t you enliven me?",Michael
7110,I don’t think you’re good at making tough decisions!,Ah.,Michael
7111,"At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it’s an unpopular decision.","Okay, here’s a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!",Michael
7112,"But maybe I’m here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I’ve been sitting out there, and I’ve been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.","Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don’t you run yourself out there and tell them? You call it.",Michael
7113,...,This had better be terrible.,Michael
7114,"Wow! I’m just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so…","That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it’s hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This–",Michael
7115,We just need to hear your plan for our raise.,My plan– a man– panama.,Michael
7116,"We would just like to know what’s happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?","Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we’re going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.",Michael
7117,Rank each person individually?,"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.",Michael
7118,"Well, obviously. Too bad he’s a temp and doesn’t count, so let’s get started.",Are you making a–,Michael
7119,"Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv– who’s that?",Toby.,Michael
7120,He’s not a part of this. You know that.,Just wanted to draw a picture of him.,Michael
7121,"Okay, your move.",Alright! Who to pick? Who to pick?,Michael
7122,Here we go.,I… will skip a turn.,Michael
7123,"Okay, you’re gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.",I need more time.,Michael
7124,Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.,"Hey, what are you guys doing in here?",Michael
7125,"No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? Okay.",...,Michael
7126,What does a bean mean?,How you doing?,Michael
7127,"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I’d say I’m about a four.","Oh, what are you usually?",Michael
7128,Six. You?,"Usually a ten, but I’m feeling like a zero.",Michael
7129,"I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?","I know, I know.",Michael
7130,We tried to find the fairest way to do it.,"Yes, we did.",Michael
7131,I just– what?,"Um, nothing. I just… I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.",Michael
7132,Thank you.,You’re welcome.,Michael
7133,What’s in here?,Gin.,Michael
7134,Ooh!,Just pretend we’re not here.,Michael
7135,"Yeah, but aren’t you supposed to do that to our… no. It’s great.",It’s just a really important day for me.,Michael
7136,"Well, congrats.",Thanks.,Michael
7137,"Really, Pam…",Yes she does. Yes she does. We’re all gonna go and we’re gonna have a good time.,Michael

7140,"What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara.",Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You stole my joke. Don’t steal my joke.,Michael
7141,No… I didn’t steal your joke.,Yes. I said that yesterday.,Michael
7142,But you can say that about anything.,Dwight…,Michael
7143,Oh yeah.,"No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that’s my joke.",Michael
7144,It’s easy. That’s what I’m saying.,"This is what I’m talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So… I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!",Michael
7145,I stole the guest list from Jim’s desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.,Get out of here.,Michael
7146,Yes.,"Oh, my God, Dwight.",Michael
7147,"For instance, Pam’s cousin, Jocelyn Webster.",There’s… a name.,Michael
7148,Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.,"Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.",Michael
7149,"She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.",Is that all you have on her?,Michael
7150,"Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.",You’re an idiot.,Michael
7151,What? No way!,Those glasses are super dark.,Michael
7152,Oh. God.,"Alright. We need some tunes, I think.",Michael
7153,You know what? I made you a cd…,You did?,Michael
7154,Mmm-hmm.,That was nice of you.,Michael
7155,This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.,"Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.",Michael
7156,"You’re gonna like this. “Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. ‘What’s next?’, you’re probably wondering. Don’t be scared of you’re night in heaven–”",Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?,Michael
7157,Yeah. It’s practical.,No. No. That’s not how it works.,Michael
7158,The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.,Mmm-hmm.,Michael
7159,"I’m sorry, sir, but I’m not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation?",I don’t have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.,Michael
7160,"Here’s your key, Mr. Schrute.","Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.",Michael
7161,No way. What if I meet someone?,"I’m staying in your– Come on, Dwight.",Michael
7162,No. No.,I would do the same for you.,Michael
7163,You would?,Yes.,Michael
7164,Really?,Yes… just go–,Michael
7165,"Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.",Oh. Thank God.,Michael
7166,"Oh no. Now that I don’t have a room, can I stay with you?",Um… no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can’t. And I’ll tell you why.,Michael
7167,Please?,"If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she’s going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.",Michael
7168,Mmm-hmm.,Ok.,Michael
7169,Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.,I don’t have a room?,Michael
7170,No you do not.,Ok. ‘Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.’,Michael
7171,It worked.,Jerk.,Michael
7172,Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.,Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?,Michael
7173,Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.,Not in the same bed. In the other bed.,Michael
7174,I got one queen size bed.,You… are… kidding me.,Michael
7175,"A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.","I’m not a physics major, Stanley. I’m just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?",Michael
7176,Blow my brains out.,That’s rude.,Michael
7177,"Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.","You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.",Michael
7178,No.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. She’s very conservative. So, mum’s the word.",Michael
7179,Oh.,How ya doin’?,Michael
7180,Hi.,Nice to meet you.,Michael
7181,Nice to meet you.,Who’s doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and–,Michael
7182,"Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it’s just going to be blood relatives, I think.",That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.,Michael
7183,Pretty sure everyone heard that.,Didn’t move my lips.,Michael
7184,"Jim and Pam, I can’t tell you how happy I am to be here.","Head table, where I belong.",Michael
7185,It’s just for family.,"Well, who’s that one?",Michael
7186,"Isabel Poreba. Oh, I’ve got stuff on her. In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.","What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?",Michael
7187,A little mo’ cardio.,"That’s not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn’t gonna make a toast and I’m not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? ‘I’m so smart. E=mc… squared. I drive a Smart Car.’ That’s not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.",Michael
7188,Knight Rider.,That’s a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.,Michael
7189,No.,"That’s not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.",Michael
7190,Very smart.,And… you… everybody can laugh. It doesn’t have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.,Michael
7191,No.,Yeah. Go ahead.,Michael
7192,"Pam can’t drink? I didn’t– I shouldn’t have said that. I don’t know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn’t. She shouldn’t because she’s an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That’s not true. I– no. What we want– the real reason is that, that Pam’s pregnant.","Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that… they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they’re living together, they’re having lots of consentual sex–",Michael
7193,They were living together?,"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can’t expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it’s just a different sensation.",Michael
7194,Michael.,"When you c– well? Am I wrong? They say it’s not different, but it’s a different sensation.",Michael
7195,"Oh, my God. Please.",When you use something to block– I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It’s not necessarily different for the woman–,Michael
7196,Michael.,…but it’s different for the– ok. Ok.,Michael
7197,Michael. Stop.,"Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.",Michael
7198,Alright.,Jim.,Michael
7199,I can’t believe it was me.,"I know. I can’t believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.",Michael
7200,Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?,I have not found that to be the case.,Michael
7201,I’m so sorry.,"Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.",Michael
7202,"Oh, my God. Are you serious?",There’s gonna be a free room?,Michael
7203,Oh. You’re that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse.,Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?,Michael
7204,I want to go to bed but I can’t. I can’t turn that television off.,"Oh. Ok. Well… hook you up, there.",Michael
7205,Oh. Thank you.,You’re welcome.,Michael
7206,It was that horrible Charlie Rose.,"Oh. Isn’t he terrible? May I? Here’s the thing. Umm… Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It’s not 1890 anymore. It’s modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That’s part of life.",Michael
7207,People are like cats and dogs these days.,Exactly.,Michael
7208,This used to be such a great country.,I know.,Michael
7209,I don’t know what happened to it.,"They’re gonna name the baby after you, you know. They’re gonna call it Mema.",Michael
7210,"You mean, Sylvia.","Yes, and if it’s a boy they will call it Sylvio.",Michael
7211,"What? It’s a casual, social outfit.","Looks like you’re going to a fish fry, Dwight.",Michael
7212,No. They’re howling at the moon. It’s suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.,"Ok. That’s not appropriate. Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. Ok. Ok. Come on. Let’s go.",Michael
7213,"I’m just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.","Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It’s not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.",Michael
7214,Michael.,Yes.,Michael
7215,Drop this one. Abort.,Why?,Michael
7216,I found twins.,"Oh, my God. Twins. I’m sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.",Michael
7217,Aren’t they magnificent?,"They’re men, Dwight.",Michael
7218,I love finding a good set of twins.,Something is wrong with you.,Michael
7219,Uh…,"Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly.",Michael
7220,"I love you. Okay, I gotta–I gotta go!",I love you!,Michael
7221,Mmm! It’s after midnight.,You’re married. He’s married!,Michael
7222,Oh my goodness.,Oh my God. You’re not going to be able to talk back.,Michael
7223,You’ll have Pam to answer to.,"She’ll be sitting home saying, “Jim… take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons.” “And… and clip my toenails.”",Michael
7224,“Jim… hey why don’t you braid my hair. I want to watch TV.”,Now you sound like Kermit.,Michael
7225,Okay.,"Hey, good morning. It’s about damn time. I haven’t gone to the bathroom in a day and a half. Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit.",Michael
7226,I’m ravenous after a night of love making. You?,"Yeah, I’m hungry, but I’m not going to make a pig out of myself.",Michael
7227,"Hey, what was she like?",She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.,Michael
7228,Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?,She was from Europe.,Michael
7229,No kidding.,Uh-huh.,Michael
7230,I bet she had hairy armpits.,No.,Michael
7231,"Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn’t think this is going anywhere.",Wait a second. You’re not into her? Are you kidding me?,Michael
7232,No.,She’s Pam’s best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?,Michael
7233,Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.,No… you’re crazy.,Michael
7234,Look. She’s a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She’s a bumpkin. Pass.,She’s– okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people’s teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they’re not scared when the dentist comes in. It– it–,Michael
7235,You should ask her out.,I already have my European girlfriend.,Michael
7236,"It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you.","Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know… I give them cash every week, so– how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory. And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me.",Michael
7237,"So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene’s and Filene’s basement.","Hey, hey… He’s not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?",Michael
7238,I’m standing. I’m a bridesmaid.,"Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?",Michael
7239,"Oh, yeah–",Oh! Eww… apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or–,Michael
7240,No.,Oh… okay. Were you saving it?,Michael
7241,"Oh, no, no, no. That’s okay. I was just–I’ve had a very rough weekend.",I’m sorry. Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.,Michael
7242,Oh–,"I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm.",Michael
7243,Oh that sounds awful.,And… and the love of my life is dating somebody else.,Michael
7244,Oh–,It is a terrible year for love.,Michael
7245,Yeah. Guess it is.,I’m thinking about having my sperm frozen.,Michael
7246,Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back.,"Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually. There you go. Use it in good health.",Michael
7247,"Well we are here now, so let’s just–",Yes! Yes! I have so much joy… in my heart… right now. How do I look?,Michael
7248,Okay then!,"Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.",Michael
7249,Well the “fun” is in it.,Get out.,Michael
7250,"Yeah, I know.","Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can’t just go right to the selling, you need “small talk.” What topics can you use for small talk?",Michael
7251,Golf.,Mmhm.,Michael
7252,Stock market.,Mmhm.,Michael
7253,Dave Matthews.,"Yes, what else?",Michael
7254,"Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes…",No.,Michael
7255,The weekend!,"Yeah! That’s good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let’s do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, “So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?”",Michael
7256,Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.,All right…,Michael
7257,He calls it an upper decker.,"Okay, okay. God. What you people don’t know about business, I could fill a book with.",Michael
7258,Then do it.,What?,Michael
7259,"Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He’s the person you should talk to.","Oh hi. I’m sorry, just a sec. Erin, you’re supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?",Michael
7260,In your schedule it just says nine til noon is “creative space” and I thought this could be part of that.,Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.,Michael
7261,You don’t have anything in the afternoon. It just says “free play.”,Push free play til tomorrow morning. Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You’re seeing how the sausage gets made.,Michael
7262,Ah.,Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.,Michael
7263,"As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride.",Mmhm.,Michael
7264,But you also got a lot of responsibility,Yep.,Michael
7265,"None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss.",Okay.,Michael
7266,God forbid you… should have a fire in the warehouse.,"Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.",Michael
7267,"Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there’s injury.","Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.",Michael
7268,You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.,"Okay, well.",Michael
7269,I can be very very persistent.,Do your worst.,Michael
7270,Do your worst.,"Oh, great.",Michael
7271,"Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?",Mmhm.,Michael
7272,What happened in there?,"Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.",Michael
7273,Did he threaten you?,"No Dwight, not everything is a threat.",Michael
7274,Mobsters are!,There is no such things as monsters.,Michael
7275,"No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.","Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.",Michael
7276,"For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.","I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.",Michael
7277,Exactly.,He did talk about a fire in the warehouse… and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.,Michael
7278,"Well first of all, there is no such thing as ‘The Mafia.’",Okay.,Michael
7279,What you have are specific families. What’s the guy’s last name?,"Um it is, Grotti.",Michael
7280,No I disagree. “R” is among the most menacing of sounds. That’s why they call it “murder.” And not “muck-duck.”,Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.,Michael
7281,Lock your door!,I’m not gonna lock my door.,Michael
7282,"Already? This, this guy is persistent!",“I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.”,Michael
7283,That’s bad.,Yeah.,Michael
7284,That’s bad.,"Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?",Michael
7285,Yeah right! You heard him! He’s gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.,"Okay, I’m calling the police.",Michael
7286,He’s right. Cops can’t do anything until a crime has been reported.,All right.,Michael
7287,"Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!",Shh!,Michael
7288,You know what?,That’s not gonna happen.,Michael
7289,That’s how it works!,What am I supposed to do here?,Michael
7290,"When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back",I was thinking exactly the same thing.,Michael
7291,"The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.","I don’t know, I don’t know about that.",Michael
7292,I like this plan. I’d like to officially withdraw my plan.,"Hold on, hold on! Just-",Michael
7293,"No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.","All right. I will meet with him, but I’m not going alone.",Michael
7294,"To change tires, no. But it’s metal, I can hit somebody with it.","Let’s go, come on. God!",Michael
7295,You’re wearing loafers!,Forget it! Forget it!,Michael
7296,Oh! God!,Oh my God!,Michael

7298,Mr. Scott.,Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.,Michael
7299,"So, you got this table?",Yes.,Michael

7307,"What he’s trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.","Guys, guys-",Michael
7308,I don’t really think that we have that.,That’s okay.,Michael
7309,Bring him the gabba-gool!,"Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.",Michael
7310,Okay.,"If the salad is on top, I send it back.",Michael
7311,Yes I can.,"No, no no, no. Come on. I’m sorry, we’re having our salad.",Michael
7312,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.","Hey, do you need any help?",Michael
7313,"I’m sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down.",He’s a good mechanic.,Michael
7314,Where were we?,I don’t…,Michael
7315,He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.,"Okay, okay okay.",Michael
7316,So we’re choosing…,"Yep, all right.",Michael
7317,Check out Dental?,Put it down.,Michael
7318,Just do it.,Okay.,Michael
7319,Yes.,Okay.,Michael
7320,"I don’t understand, why would you buy a policy?",It’s just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.,Michael
7321,"You were man enough to back down Michael, I’m proud of you.",I had to make a snap decision Dwight.,Michael
7322,"It wasn’t a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",It was a lot of snap decisions.,Michael
7323,Do you know what “snap decision” means?,Yes!,Michael
7324,It means like this.,Just get in the car.,Michael
7325,Hello?,Jim?,Michael
7326,Michael?,Oh thank God.,Michael
7327,"How did you get this number? Michael, we’re on a catamaran.","It wasn’t easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I’m in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.",Michael
7328,That sounds bad.,"Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I’m turning to you my friend.",Michael
7329,I’m gonna help you through it all right?,Okay!,Michael
7330,All you’re gonna need to and- it- and then go to–,Jim? Are you?,Michael
7331,And then you’ll be saved.,"What? Wait, I didn’t hear a thing you just said.",Michael
7332,Just and then you’ll be saved.,"No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!",Michael
7333,A- ah–,No! Oh my God!,Michael
7334,And you’ll be saved.,"No, Jim please, repeat what you’re saying! I can’t understand you!",Michael

7336,"Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.",Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?,Michael
7337,Just- no. No.,"All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.",Michael
7338,Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.,No. He’s not. He’s just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don’t understand how this works.,Michael
7339,Class act. Boy scout.,But Grotti acts like he’s mafia though.,Michael
7340,And he made us all look like chumps!,...,Michael
7341,This is Grotti.,This is Scott.,Michael
7342,"Oh! Great. Michael, I’m finishing up your paperwork right now.",Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?,Michael
7343,"I, I thought you’d be pleased.",Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I’m actually kind of PO’d.,Michael
7344,What?,"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.",Michael
7345,I don’t get it. How was I scaring you?,I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.,Michael
7346,Whoa. Okay.,You suck!,Michael
7347,Okay that’s-,And I’m not gonna buy your stupid insurance.,Michael
7348,"That’s good, let’s wrap it up.","How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?",Michael
7349,"Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don’t you give me a call?",Doubt it.,Michael
7350,Oh man.,What a tool. What?,Michael
7351,"Next time you look in the mirror, you’re gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!",No. What do you mean?,Michael
7352,"We just told you he wasn’t mafia, so you wouldn’t be scared.",What?,Michael
7353,You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!,Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I’m not.,Michael
7354,"Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.",Erin?,Michael

7373,"Oh, Jesus!","Get the hell out of here, idiot.",Michael
7374,"Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.","I think you’re underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.",Michael
7375,"No, not more than anything.","Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-",Michael
7376,Don’t call her “the mom.”,She’s right on my way home from work.,Michael
7377,"Then take a different way home, man!","I di- alright, I’ll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.",Michael

7398,There’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down…,"I’m sleeping with Pam’s mom. Sometimes, dinner.",Michael
7399,Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?,"That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I’m not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people’s needs ahead of our own.",Michael
7400,And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.,"Who wants to help the world one step at a time? Alright, good.",Michael
7401,Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.,"Alright, that’s…",Michael

7406,Yes! Angela! Please…,Can you hold down the fort? Hey boo!,Michael
7407,Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally…,What’s it… why are you crying?,Michael
7408,Shhh…,"No, no, no, I’ll talk to her. I will… No… nobody talks to my baby that way… uh ah… yeah, I’ll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle.",Michael
7409,Who’s pickle?,"Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.",Michael
7410,I’m not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology.,For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?,Michael
7411,That is not okay dude.,"Alright, in my defense…",Michael
7412,You have no sense of boundaries Michael.,"Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I’m outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me?

7417,"You are never going to be my father, you get out!","I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am…",Michael
7418,"Yeah, sure, what’s up?","Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was… uncalled for, I’m sorry.",Michael
7419,"Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot. Thank you for saying it.",Can I sit down for a second?,Michael
7420,"Yeah, er… pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.","This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.",Michael
7421,"Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.",She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.,Michael
7422,"Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.",Really? Would you do that?,Michael
7423,Yeah… that’s why they pay me the big bucks.,"You’re a good, good guy.",Michael

7428,"Barely, I… I don’t have all the facts. Frank and Bean…","Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we’re gonna get past this? Cause, I will.",Michael
7429,"Mmmmm, yes!","Well, that is not gonna happen!",Michael

7464,So a child had fallen in?,Not yet!,Michael

7474,Yeah. Every single day.,You never said anything.,Michael
7475,"Uh, we have. Countless times.","Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, ‘Stop because I want you to stop’ or STOP as in ‘Stop. You’re making me laugh so hard. What you’re doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!’",Michael
7476,That’s never the case.,"We are going to make a ‘Do Not Mock’ list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list.

7487,Thank you.,No. We are not done here. This-,Michael
7488,"I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.","No, Jim. You don’t understand. Things like this don’t just die. Kids in high school still call me ‘Ponytail’.",Michael

7494,"Michael, please. Stop it now. You’re embarrassing yourself.","It’s ok. We’re having fun. It’s not actually the first time I’ve been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh… it was freezing. No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, ‘Who are your 5 friends?’ and I’m, like, ‘Uh… ‘ I didn’t even know I couldn’t even think. Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don’t even have Jan’s cell phone number and I hate her! She won’t give it to me. I was like, ‘Oh, I guess I’m a loser. ‘A luh-whooooo a za her’. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.",Michael
7495,I was.,Hey. Who wants to watch Michael’s pond dive? My roommate’s friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he’s bringing it over.,Michael

7503,Thanks Michael.,You’re welcome. Whoa! Almost fell.,Michael
7504,Good morning Michael.,Morning Dwight.,Michael
7505,Hungry?,No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn’t want hers. Because I guess I’m the only aphrodisiac she needs.,Michael
7506,Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.,"Well, yeah…",Michael
7507,You’re thinking of deer penis.,It worked.,Michael
7508,Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. Bagel?,I don’t mind if I do.,Michael

7516,Because of sex?,Hey–,Michael
7517,Kevin!,"Please, Kevin. You’re fired. Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go?",Michael

7531,"Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out. It just– doesn’t interest me.","So it’s a matter of interest. Good, okay. It’s not anything you would have ever done.",Michael
7532,"Hmm… I might have done it when I was younger, but now there’s just other things I’d rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming–",Well there’s no jumping in a triathlon.,Michael
7533,Oh–,You’re thinking of the broad jump. Would you try– bungee jumping?,Michael
7534,"No, no…",Snowboarding?,Michael
7535,You want to go snowboarding?,I might.,Michael
7536,"Michael, what are you talking about?",Nothing. Just life– and doing things– before you die. I don’t know.,Michael
7537,What about your gift Michael?,"Oh, no, no, no. No. It’s stupid. You’d hate it. I hate it.",Michael
7538,I’m sure I won’t.,Yes you will.,Michael
7539,Aww–,I literally– I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.,Michael

7541,A poem!,Oh that I plagiarized I think.,Michael
7542,"I think it’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful.","Well, that’s because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It’s a generational– sort of gap between us.",Michael

7544,Hey. Where’d you go?,"Oh, just went to the bathroom.",Michael
7545,And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?,I got thirsty.,Michael
7546,"Oh, I know. I love how they use butter cream frosting.","Finish your cake, Helene.",Michael

7548,"Michael. Michael ,it’s okay.",No it’s not.,Michael
7549,"I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy.",Wow. That just– you’ve really grown.,Michael
7550,Well–,"Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who– who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I’ve never– I don’t know him. There’s another woman.

7551,"Okay, so–","And I want kids. And you… unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.",Michael

7611,“It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.”,"No, no, that doesn’t make any sense.",Michael
7612,"Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they’re just restructuring to get out of debt.","Oh, that sounds awful.",Michael
7613,Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.,"Oh God. Well, that’s an interesting theory.",Michael
7614,"I’m sorry, Michael, David’s in a meeting.","Ah, well maybe you should spy on him. Oh my God, wouldn’t that be hilarious!",Michael

7632,"It’s my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.","Who’s Michael? I’m Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.",Michael
7633,You don’t have to keep saying “I do declare”. Any time you say something it means you are declaring.,That is the way Southern people talk.,Michael
7634,And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?,"Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery?",Michael
7635,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. I’m the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!","No, no, no. Don’t turn this into a political thing.",Michael
7636,"I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if’n she don’t mind.","Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!",Michael

7663,Hate the twirl!,Ok. Obviously I’m not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.,Michael
7664,The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there’s no where to get it.,"Ok, Oscar, I don’t need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",Michael
7665,Those are the bullet points.,"Well, could you condense it please?",Michael
7666,Michael? The limo’s here for you.,"It’s not a limo. It’s a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.",Michael

7694,You’re a criminal.,"Hey, hey, hey. I’m sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today.

7778,"The principal told me that 90% of Scott’s Tots are on track to graduate, and that’s 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn’t made that promise, a lot of them would’ve dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think.",I think you’re doing a great job.,Michael

7920,"Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.","You know what can’t fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything’s running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.",Michael
7921,Oop.,What?,Michael
7922,"Oh, I don’t get that sense at all from you, so…","Well, you should have a little. But it’s great that you don’t, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I’m – I’ll be honest, I’m having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of ’em.",Michael

I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and –",Michael
7928,"Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson’s snowball company, so you’ll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things.",Ok. I feel very strongly that you can’t just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because… he knows. He’d know what to do.,Michael

7957,"Michael, this isn’t a toast. You’re just thinking out loud.","Here’s my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.",Michael
7958,Just ’cause you have liquid that doesn’t make it a toast.,Here’s the toast. I’m gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.,Michael

7966,"Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we’ve been fully booked for months.","Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that.

7968,Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?,That’s it!,Michael
7969,"Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize.","Uh-huh, okay…",Michael

7976,"I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.",I humbly accept the management position.,Michael
7977,I… Why would you just say something like that?,"Because, well, Jim. Where I’m from, two types of folk: those who ain’t, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain’t you ain’t? Ya’ll come back now.",Michael
7978,Do you even know what that means?,Yes.,Michael
7979,"That’s right, darlin’, now you’re the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what’s going on now?

7981,They’re the easiest-to-use printers on the market.,I will try to manage my excitement!,Michael
7982,"Hey, you got a second?",Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?,Michael
7983,"Actually, yeah.",What?,Michael
7984,Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.,What? Really?,Michael
7985,Yeah!,Wow!,Michael
7986,Michael. Reading.,What are you reading?,Michael
7987,The Atlantic.,"Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can’t keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.",Michael
7988,I should step into sales myself.,"Why, is there an untapped gay market?",Michael
7989,Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.,…Where did you get that information.,Michael

7991,"Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat!",Okay.,Michael
7992,Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager.,"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",Michael
7993,Really.,"Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can’t take the sales out of salesman.",Michael
7994,"No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.","No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.",Michael
7995,Why would you do that?,I’m turning myself in right now!,Michael
7996,"You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I’m gonna defer to your judgment.",Thank you.,Michael
7997,"I think you will become the salesman, and congratulations! You’re gonna be the new manager of this branch!","Great! That’s great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.",Michael
7998,"Michael, I’m worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.",How is that possible?,Michael
7999,"Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.","No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.",Michael
8000,"You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he’s manager.","Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? Michael Scott, head of sales.",Michael
8001,"You know, we really don’t announce out loud our sales that much.",Why not? It’s part of the sales experience.,Michael
8002,It’s not really 1992 anymore.,"Well, okay…",Michael
8003,"Michael, stop.","No, I’m serious, we don’t have to put up… Is it the dogs?",Michael

8006,I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I’m on.,Are you kidding me?,Michael
8007,No.,And you guys are okay with this?,Michael
8008,It’s not cause of the smell. I’m just expecting a nosebleed.,Oh my God.,Michael

8010,"Well, the grass is always greener.",Yeah. Except there’s no grass out there. It’s just a farty dirt patch.,Michael
8011,"Well, it’s what you wanted.",I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.,Michael
8012,"For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I’m not really sure what we do.","We make a poster that says “Happy Opposite Day!” and she sees it on the way out… Nah, that’s stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.",Michael
8013,"Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could’ve just gone and talked to her.",Lethal Weapon?,Michael
8014,"You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don’t need so much management?",What? What I’m saying…,Michael
8015,"Michael’s saying he’s better at being manager, and I agree, cause he’s a better people person, weirdly.","And weirdly I’m a good dog person, right guys? See? They love me.",Michael
8016,Alright.,Alright!,Michael
8017,"Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.","Erin, what about my keyboard? Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?",Michael
8018,Ooh.,"Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She’s contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car…",Michael
8019,Michael.,"Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.",Michael
8020,"Michael, you shouldn’t have done that.","Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.",Michael
8021,"You know the baby’s not going to live here, right?","Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.",Michael
8022,"Hmm, that logic’s air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn’t conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.","Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don’t want to know. Tell me later. Let’s go! Let’s go! Hospital!",Michael
8023,"Well, you don’t want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby’s going to become a teenager in there and you’ll be up all night, from the rock music.","Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don’t get revenge on me, nerd.",Michael
8024,"You know, it’s getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day’s not out yet.","No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can’t tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.",Michael
8025,"Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don’t think I’m going to make it until midnight if I’m just sitting here thinking about it.","Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let’s go!",Michael

8032,"Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.","Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let’s have happy times.",Michael
8033,Alright.,"Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I’m thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.",Michael
8034,"Um, stimulate the nipples.","Okay, nobody touch Pam’s nipples. Think of Pam’s nipples as Toby’s grundle.",Michael
8035,I have a shirt like that in my car.,"Okay, yeah, why don’t you go get it?",Michael

8040,"No, it’s 4:35.","4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn’t have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let’s go to the hospital, shall we?",Michael
8041,"No, not yet, Michael.",We can do…,Michael
8042,"Oh, wow, it’s almost time for ultra feast! Where’s Kevin?",Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?,Michael
8043,That’s fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.,What is October feast?,Michael
8044,"Mm-hmm. Yes, I’m fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it’s still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.","Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it’s time to go to the hospital.",Michael
8045,Alright. Time to go. Okay.,"That’s right, let’s do this.",Michael

8076,"Michael, come on!","I’m texting about you, okay!?",Michael
8077,"Pam, no! Are you nuts? We’re going to the hospital now.","Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. Ready?",Michael
8078,Dwight Schrute.,"Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.",Michael
8079,Why didn’t you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM’ing you how bored I was.,Okay.,Michael
8080,Yes.,"Do you have everything, guys?",Michael
8081,"Michael, just go park the car.","Okay, alright.",Michael

8084,Okay.,"Okay, not yet, not yet. I’m going to go wash my eyes.",Michael
8085,This is ridiculous. We just can’t wait here.,I think it’s going to be any minute now.,Michael
8086,"But you don’t know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour.","Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?",Michael
8087,I have an ice cream cake in the car.,"Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.",Michael
8088,This is happening!,"You’re starting, you’re kinda losing them.",Michael

8097,Ready?,"Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.",Michael
8098,This man has a gift!,Who else here is single?,Michael

8100,Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?,"Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don’t have any? Who else? Come on! People, I know models!",Michael
8101,"Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.","Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you’re obviously single.",Michael
8102,You wanted to see me?,"What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?",Michael
8103,Ta-da!,I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.,Michael
8104,"Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me.","Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop ’em in your mouth. Why don’t you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?",Michael
8105,Okay.,Good!,Michael
8106,"Michael, could I talk to you privately?","Sure. Kevin, please leave.",Michael
8107,Bye.,Bye.,Michael
8108,"I’m so sorry if I gave you the impression I’m into Kevin, but I’m not. I like Andy.",Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.,Michael
8109,I’m sure he’ll be fine.,"I’m not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.",Michael
8110,I don’t want anyone to die.,Just don’t let him sit on you… I’m kidding. You’ll have fun. It’ll be good. It’ll be good. There he is. Go to him.,Michael
8111,Yeah.,"Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?",Michael
8112,You said she liked me.,"Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I’m surprised that you didn’t question me in the first place.",Michael
8113,I’ve dumped better than Erin.,No.,Michael
8114,"Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.",Lynn was as hot as Erin.,Michael
8115,"Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.","This isn’t about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you… Yes, Andy?",Michael

8117,Oh good morning sweetheart.,"Morning, honey-pile.",Michael
8118,I’m sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?,It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.,Michael
8119,Is that a lump of coal?,Yes it is!,Michael
8120,Have I been that naughty?,"No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.",Michael
8121,"Err, thank you very much. We, we don’t get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I’m used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you’ve ever tasted.","Mm, that sounds great, actually.",Michael
8122,"Now, after all the talking I’ve been doing. It’s your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.",That is a great idea JB.,Michael
8123,I have a question.,"Oscar, homosexual accountant.",Michael
8124,"I am so proud of Sabre’s “Print In All Colors” initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. Daryl?","Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse…",Michael

8129,"Well, anytime now.",How about July 4th weekend?,Michael
8130,Oh honey you didn’t buy a ticket?,I did!,Michael
8131,"Oh honey. I’m not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?","You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and –",Michael
8132,Enough!,"All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.",Michael
8133,"No, that’s very generous of you, but I’m all set.",No is not an option.,Michael
8134,Yes it is.,"All right. Well if you need me, I’ll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.",Michael
8135,How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?,I’ll be over there.,Michael
8136,"Not bad, huh?","A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo’s eye. How’d you make that happen?",Michael
8137,I impressed her with my good ideas.,"Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?",Michael
8138,I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.,"How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?",Michael
8139,"Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.",Okay. All right.,Michael
8140,Hey there.,Hey there. So I think I’m done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.,Michael
8141,Well there’s chatting time and there’s working time. I’m still on working time.,"Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.",Michael
8142,"Well, if you feel like you’ve done a solid days work…",Right. What?,Michael
8143,"Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you’ve done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.",Mm. mm. Oh well.,Michael
8144,Anything else I can help you with?,"No, no, no. That’s super-clear-ish. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.",Michael
8145,"Hey what’s up, Butt-plug?",How you doing stud? You already there?,Michael
8146,"Dude, I’ve been here since three! I’ve boot and rallied twice.",How’s the lady situation?,Michael
8147,Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.,"Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.",Michael
8148,"Oh here’s what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!",Yeah. Maybe next year.,Michael
8149,Overnight all my damn bags home. I’m carrying nothing but my Sable gloves. I’ve had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.,How late do we have to work tonight?,Michael
8150,You never know with Jo. Sometimes we’re here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn’t show up for three days.,Why does she do that? Why doesn’t she just tell you what your schedule is?,Michael
8151,Anything I can do for you Puddin’?,"There is, as a matter of fact. It’s getting sorta late. It’s 8:30. And it’s St. Patrick’s Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I’m going to dismiss my employees.",Michael
8152,Hmm.,"I’m thrilled with the work they’ve done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.",Michael
8153,All right then.,"Okay. Happy St. Patrick’s Day. And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.",Michael
8154,Michael?,Yes.,Michael
8155,...,Drinks are on me!,Michael
8156,"No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!",Oh -hoh! All right.,Michael
8157,Whoops!,"Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. What the hell is going on back there?",Michael
8158,No.,"Look at him. Look at him – t-shirt, jeans…",Michael
8159,Is he you?,I am flattered. That’s Johnny Depp.,Michael
8160,Where did you take that?,In my condo complex.,Michael
8161,"Oh my God, that’s right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.","I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.",Michael
8162,Sure. That they should do one.,"Hey, Jim, Jim – where, where do I find the Black Pearl?",Michael

8164,John Dillinger.,No. I’m Captain Jack Sparrow.,Michael
8165,Captain Crunch.,"Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it’s not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you’d seen Roger Clemens?",Michael
8166,At the Yankees game. Yeah.,"Yeah. Well, it wasn’t him.",Michael
8167,"I had a little better reason to believe that… You’re right. You’re right. Well, you’re not right, because Johnny Depp…","I know, I know.",Michael
8168,…in your condo complex.,I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.,Michael
8169,"Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?","Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company… are not here yet. But will be.. No, no, meeting’s not over.",Michael
8170,But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?,No sales topic per se.,Michael
8171,Well then no Andy Bernard per se.,Dwight?,Michael
8172,"Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.","I would like your undivided attention, please.",Michael
8173,"Listen, Michael – about what happened earlier.",Yeah.,Michael
8174,When I was asking about the leads.,M-hmm.,Michael
8175,… is there any news on the leads?,Is that all you have to say to me?,Michael
8176,"Oh, sorry, wait one second.",Stop sexting Pam. I’m trying to congratulate you.,Michael
8177,"This is actually a big potential sale, so…",You writing your memoirs over there?,Michael
8178,You writing your name over there?,"Well, it’s a pretty big check.",Michael
8179,"That’s good. You know, with the kid.",Okay. Don’t gloat. Here’s the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.,Michael
8180,"Alright, here we go. Michael…","I’m just saying, that –",Michael
8181,Michael.,"Oh, you got to be kidding me. Look at that. That’s –",Michael
8182,I know who did that.,You saw who did this and you didn’t stop them?,Michael
8183,Didn’t have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.,The sales department smashed my sandwich.,Michael
8184,"Yes. All of ’em. Together. It’s a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.",You don’t get it.,Michael
8185,You need to get back on top.,That’s what she said.,Michael
8186,Yeah.,Yeah.,Michael
8187,"Something came for you, Michael.",Thank you very much.,Michael
8188,What’d you get?,"Ah, just the stupid leads.",Michael
8189,"Finally, Michael. Hand ’em over, numbnuts. But seriously. It’s your job to give us those leads.","Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don’t. Not even Sabre owns this place. It’s a rental. I’m kind of sick of the attitude around here. I’m sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim… I think I am not going to give these to you.",Michael
8190,"Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.","Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just – imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.",Michael
8191,"Michael, I don’t want to incentivise murder. But – we’ve tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff –",They act like I have no power.,Michael
8192,"– of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.","Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.",Michael
8193,"Okay, good.",Exactly that.,Michael
8194,Good.,Exactly that.,Michael
8195,What are you –,– and to King Meredith!,Michael
8196,They aren’t salespeople!,And to King Angela! Because today we are all kings. And queens .,Michael
8197,What the hell do you think you’re doing?,"I’m giving them the leads, Phyllis.",Michael
8198,Hey.,Hey.,Michael
8199,"So I’m going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one’s going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?",Mm-hmm.,Michael
8200,"Alright. So why don’t you just give me my share of the leads, and I’ll start making some calls?",Okay.,Michael
8201,"Hey, alright.",Alright.,Michael
8202,"Ahh, these aren’t leads. What are they?","Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don’t respect the father who doesn’t respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",Michael
8203,I don’t think you understand –,I do understand it.,Michael
8204,This one’s a map.,Or is it?,Michael
8205,"Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.","Well, bigshot, ‘If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes’.",Michael
8206,It’s empty!,Wait. What day is today?,Michael
8207,"Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.","Oh my god. Oh my god oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey wait, wait!",Michael
8208,"Michael, why would we all go to the dump?","Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, ‘Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they’re now in the city dump.”",Michael
8209,"Not your staff, Michael. You.","Well, that’s not the way it’s going t sound. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’ll go to the dump, we’ll look around, then we’ll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you –",Michael
8210,"Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?",Really?,Michael
8211,"I’m not going. You did this, not us.","Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit Complicit. You were all successories!",Michael
8212,"That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.",You can.,Michael
8213,I can’t. You know that.,"Okay fine, I get it. I’ll just go by myself.",Michael
8214,This place has gone to hell.,"You know, Dwight, there was a time when you’d be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.",Michael
8215,"Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.","Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don’t believe me, look in my gutters.",Michael
8216,"Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?","Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.",Michael
8217,Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.,"No, I’m talking about your personality, Dwight.",Michael
8218,"When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I’d assistant managed him –",Assistant to the managed him –,Michael
8219,"Oh, that’s low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!",Yeah.,Michael
8220,"Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you – you, going nowhere.",You think you would have done better without me? Really?,Michael
8221,I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.,Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend – I shouldn’t have been hanging out watching karate movies with you –,Michael
8222,Kung-fu movies!,"You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies –",Michael
8223,Nice babies you’re making with the floozies at the bars.,"That’s my wife you’re talking about, man.",Michael
8224,Your made-up wife? Who doesn’t exist? You watch it!,"If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.",Michael
8225,Don’t do it,"No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. No, time out, time out. Time in!",Michael
8226,No!,Don’t even think about that,Michael
8227,Oh,"We’re never going to find those leads, are we?",Michael
8228,"Hey You know who’d like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?","Yeah, she does – she loves purple. Does it stink?",Michael
8229,Yeah,"Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That’s it. And the caption would read:",Michael
8230,Hope – grows.,In the dump.,Michael
8231,Good news that you found our leads?,No! Better!,Michael

8235,Okay.,"Oh, what did you do today?",Michael
8236,I made a sale.,"Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.",Michael
8237,What do we get if we do ’em?,"My respect. Okay, I’ll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups –",Michael
8238,And one girl push-up.,"Gets to go home. Ooh! I say ‘dance,’ they say ‘how high?’ Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. Disqualified!",Michael
8239,Ow!,"What do we got? Creed, disqualified.",Michael
8240,19. I had a really hard work out this morning.,"Oh, wow, that is adorable!",Michael
8241,Ten…,"Yeah, I’m betting one more.",Michael
8242,"Eleven, wow!",Good.,Michael
8243,Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley…,"Alright, alright.",Michael
8244,"Hey, boss man.",Yes?,Michael
8245,"A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?","Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.",Michael

8258,I am an ESL teacher.,Really?,Michael
8259,Yeah.,"See, I didn’t think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?",Michael
8260,Are you thinking that I said ‘ESP?’,Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.,Michael

8276,Get out. Now.,"Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I’m just kidding around. I’m sorry.",Michael
8277,"Ok, um, why don’t we just finish the game? Michael, it’s your shot.",She can’t talk to us that way.,Michael
8278,"You guys are stripes, I think…","You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?",Michael
8279,It stopped.,"Well, I am starting it again!",Michael
8280,Then I am sorry that I didn’t kick you out.,I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.,Michael
8281,"Well, uh, I’m the manager here, sir.","Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don’t see that from you.",Michael
8282,Is that how you do it?,Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.,Michael
8283,Really? How much have you written?,I’ve written all of it… in my head.,Michael

8293,You just won yourself a lunch.,"Oh, hey guys.",Michael
8294,Yeah!,"Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.",Michael
8295,Not at all.,"I think I did. But I can’t take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.",Michael
8296,I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary’s Day.,I’m going to give Erin $15.,Michael
8297,I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.,A one-on-one lunch with Erin?,Michael
8298,Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there’s only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary’s Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. .,She’s kind of a rube.,Michael
8299,That’s my girlfriend you’re talking about.,Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I’ll take her to lunch.,Michael
8300,"Well, happy Boss’s day. There wouldn’t be a secretary if there was no boss.",I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to… lunch.,Michael
8301,I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth’s.,Ugh.,Michael
8302,Just the two of us.,"Well, Hayworth’s is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I’m…",Michael
8303,"Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth’s, but…","Okay, well, we’ll figure something.",Michael
8304,Oh.,"Okay, let’s go to Hayworth’s.",Michael
8305,Okay.,All right.,Michael
8306,I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?,I don’t know.,Michael
8307,I would have chosen the 1490’s.,Ahhh.,Michael
8308,‘Cause America was discovered.,Right.,Michael
8309,"And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don’t know, I couldn’t keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So it’s like… I don’t mean that I didn’t like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn’t have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?",An age or month?,Michael
8310,How many pillows do you sleep on at night?,So how are things going with Andy?,Michael
8311,He’s the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.,"Well, let’s see. Um… Andy. Plays the banjo.",Michael
8312,Yeah I love that.,"Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don’t think he is a snappy dresser.",Michael
8313,What?,I don’t think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.,Michael
8314,Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?,Mm-hmm. You didn’t know that? Oh.,Michael
8315,Here we go. Hot plate.,Okay.,Michael
8316,Why wouldn’t he tell me that?,I don’t know. Probably didn’t want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.,Michael
8317,They had sex?,"They were engaged, so… Okay, you know what, sir?",Michael
8318,Yes?,"Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?",Michael
8319,Of course. I’ll get you a bowl of pickles.,Thank you.,Michael
8320,"Uhhhh, they were engaged?",Mm-hmm. Yeah.,Michael
8321,Uh-oh…,Well…,Michael
8322,...,What are you doing? What are you doing?,Michael
8323,"In the Foster home, my hair was my room.","Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody’s looking at you right now.",Michael
8324,...,I’ll have what she’s having!,Michael
8325,"Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.","You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela’s not so great, so..",Michael
8326,I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.,No. No. No.,Michael
8327,Specific shout-out..,Stop talking.,Michael
8328,I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.,Oh God.,Michael
8329,Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary’s Day?,"Andy, she’s not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn’t tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That’s like.. that’s like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",Michael
8330,"I was going to tell her, just on my own time.","You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can’t and won’t keep a secret.",Michael
8331,...,Erin?,Michael
8332,Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.,"No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",Michael
8333,I can’t trust Andy anymore.,Oh. Yep. I’m sorry about that. I feel… I’m sorry I caused that thing.,Michael
8334,It’s Andy’s fault.,"Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn’t worry about Angela. She doesn’t hold a candle to you, Erin. She’s old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she’s, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don’t think she’s ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.",Michael
8335,"Oh, I like his butt.",You said butt.,Michael
8336,You tricked me!,"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: “Hey! Hey Scott!”",Michael
8337,But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.,"Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? “Oscar. I am the Count.” Nailed him. Nailed him. Good work Cookie Monster.",Michael

8339,"Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?","Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!",Michael
8340,Your office is full of genitalia.,"Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!",Michael
8341,“That’s what he says?”,"Damn it. Ah, Angelo.",Michael
8342,Angela. Michael.,Yo soy Cancun.,Michael
8343,"Yeah, or maybe we don’t even need that.",Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.,Michael

8345,How are you?,Did somebody order a hooker over here?,Michael
8346,"Oh, stop that.",Hi. How are you?,Michael
8347,"So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate So it’s a tradeoff.",Hi.,Michael
8348,Hold on one second.,"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria’s Secret?",Michael
8349,What?,Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.,Michael
8350,None of this is time sensitive.,"Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.",Michael
8351,"Oh, yeah, thank you.","Okay, I have more of them.",Michael
8352,Mm-hmm.,"And that would be a display of the crisp, gorgeous black.",Michael
8353,Who took the photo?,Ryan.,Michael
8354,Oh.,And that’s it. That’s me. That’s who I am.,Michael
8355,Not bad.,"Oh, thanks. You’re not bad, either.",Michael
8356,Thank you. Hmm.,Hmm.,Michael
8357,Oh my God.,Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?,Michael
8358,"Well, maybe you shouldn’t try to kiss people at work.","Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.",Michael
8359,Yeah.,"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?",Michael
8360,What’s that?,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?,Michael
8361,I don’t… I don’t think so.,I think we could.,Michael
8362,I don’t see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost…,"Okay, well sometimes… sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.",Michael
8363,"Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.",Why don’t you run them again?,Michael
8364,What if she’s just flirting with you to get a better price?,"If she is, it’s working.",Michael
8365,Mm-hmm.,Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. Just kidding. Do you like mints?,Michael

8367,"Oh, I haven’t tried those. No.",They’re good,Michael
8368,You want one?,Sure.,Michael
8369,"Well, why don’t you shut up!","Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it’s not totally insane to try one more time.",Michael
8370,"Michael, he’s right. You are turning into a stalker.",Okay. What do you think?,Michael
8371,"I think it’s over, man.",Andy?,Michael
8372,Ehh.,"Okay, some for, some against.",Michael

8379,Thank you. Did I… get everything?,I don’t know. I think so.,Michael
8380,"Yeah, I think so.","Okay. So… Oh, Donna?",Michael
8381,"No, it’s just in the lot, so…",Thank you so much.,Michael
8382,You’re welcome. You’re… welcome.,Mmm.,Michael
8383,Bye.,"Ahem. So, um… okay, if you have… if there’s any other questions that you have…",Michael

8391,"Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?",God. She left this here?,Michael
8392,Yeah.,Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.,Michael
8393,No.,Yeah. This could be a signal. People don’t just take barrettes off.,Michael
8394,Michael…,Well…,Michael
8395,She doesn’t want you to return the barrette. She’s not interested in you.,"Yeah, I know. I know.",Michael
8396,I’m sorry.,I know. You’re right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.,Michael

8412,"Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang’s when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.","Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, “I wanna go to Mount Pocono,” you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.",Michael
8413,"Wait, that’s crazy far. Are you sure she’s not cheating?","You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn’t see.",Michael
8414,Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It’s in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.,You guys think Donna’s cheating on me?,Michael

8416,That is right. Don’t make any more of it.,How?,Michael
8417,How what?,How do I not make any more of it?,Michael
8418,You could start by concluding this meeting.,"All right. And she won’t say, “I love you.”",Michael
8419,How many dates have you been on?,Nine dates. I said it on the second date.,Michael
8420,"Sorry, dude.","No, no…",Michael
8421,"Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",Run what?,Michael
8422,"Amok. It means, don’t let your imagination run out of control.","Why didn’t you just say that, Pam?",Michael
8423,"Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.","Well, that’s easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It’s stupid. I live in a fantasy world.",Michael
8424,You do?,"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can’t stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",Michael
8425,But you didn’t believe any of this was true five minutes ago.,That’s what makes it so wrong.,Michael
8426,"Oh, God, that tickles. What did…",I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.,Michael

8429,I’m just gonna warn you… and I say this to all my clients… you might not like what I find.,Okay.,Michael
8430,"That’s interesting. Wow, it’s a little early for ice cream, don’t you think?","It’s never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn’t have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",Michael
8431,"Oh, my God","It’s comfort food, all right? God.",Michael
8432,"You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just… stop beating yourself up.","I know. Well, I hope you’re right. We’ll see what Dwight says.",Michael
8433,Why do we have to see what Dwight says?,Because I have him investigating her. I’m waiting for a text update.,Michael
8434,"No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",It’s too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.,Michael
8435,"Michael. Okay, I’m… I’m going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.","God, this is so disgusting.",Michael
8436,Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.,I know.,Michael
8437,And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you’re in.,"That’s not true. You’re right, I ruin everything. And I’ve known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",Michael
8438,Helene.,Helene?,Michael
8439,My mother.,Oh.,Michael

8446,People who don’t trust egg whites.,"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.",Michael
8447,"Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she’s coming over here and she’s furious.","What? No, she didn’t say that.",Michael
8448,"You’re right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, “What is with him? He is crazy. I’m coming over there to talk to him.” And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You’ll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael’s office.",I am not paying for that membership.,Michael
8449,Maybe you’d be more comfortable in your own office.,"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?",Michael
8450,"Uh, no. Wait, yes.",That’s her?,Michael
8451,Yeah.,"Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. Okay, I’ll talk to you later.",Michael
8452,How could you think I would cheat on you?,I didn’t. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.,Michael
8453,That’s pathetic.,"Ye… pfff. Well, no. It’s a lie. That’s not what happened. I just like you. I can’t believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.",Michael
8454,"When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak.","If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.",Michael
8455,I told you I like you.,"Well, you are boner-ific.",Michael
8456,"Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would…",…poop my pants.,Michael

8472,Okay. Okay. Yes.,I need to have her say…,Michael
8473,"Yeah, but you have to calm…","I need to say, “What the hell is that? What the hell is that?”",Michael
8474,"Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.","No, God! No, no, oh, my God!",Michael

8514,So… here’s the thing about infidelity.,"Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.",Michael
8515,How does that work?,Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he’s an angel? I don’t think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.,Michael
8516,"In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You’re Ali Larter, I’m Beyonce.",I am Beyonce always.,Michael
8517,Not this time.,"Yes, I am.",Michael
8518,"This guy’s a high school baseball coach, right? Let’s go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.",I would love that.,Michael
8519,Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let’s go check it out.,I have work to do.,Michael
8520,"Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.",Let’s go. I can’t wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he’s making me do to her.,Michael
8521,Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum,"All right, Andy, please.",Michael
8522,Baseball!,"Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That’s him. That’s him.",Michael
8523,Where?,Right there. The coach!,Michael
8524,Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!,"Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?",Michael
8525,"And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.","All right. Can you just– can you just act normal for a second, please?",Michael
8526,Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.,You have no idea what you’re talking about.,Michael
8527,I know it’s like cricket.,"You don’t. No, no.",Michael
8528,"And it’s–there’s– well, home plate is like a wicket.","You don’t know. You don’t– you don’t know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn’t even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it’s like, “Hey, Donna, why don’t you wash the dishes?” “High-five, Donna.” “Hey, why don’t you bring me my slippers?” “Hi-five. I’m taking all the credit.”",Michael
8529,Seems pretty well liked by the team.,"Okay, well, that’s because he’s paying their salary.",Michael
8530,You do know that high school coaches don’t pay their players.,"I know, I know, I know. It–I’m–it– that was a euphemism.",Michael
8531,"Great game, coach.","Shh! Okay, all right. Don’t, don’t.",Michael
8532,Ha. The other guys can go die.,Okay.,Michael
8533,Baseball! Go talk to him.,No. God. You go talk to him.,Michael
8534,"But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!","No, no, no.",Michael
8535,"Come on, get over here.","I’m good. Oh, my God.",Michael
8536,"Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.",Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.,Michael
8537,It’s all right. It’s all right. Keep it going.,"Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart’s still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, “I’m sleeping with your wife.” And you know who does that? James freakin’ Bond.",Michael
8538,"Thanks, Michael.",Don’t thank me. Thank Dylan’s mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!,Michael
8539,Why would you throw something wet at me?,You love it. There ya go.,Michael
8540,"Now, were those for the team?","Uh, no, they didn’t say team. They just said coal Hawks.",Michael
8541,I don’t think those were yours to take.,"Well, then it wouldn’t be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.",Michael
8542,Did you talk to him?,I did.,Michael
8543,Was there a fistfight?,No. We just talked. He’s very nice.,Michael
8544,And it didn’t change your mind.,It did not.,Michael
8545,"Michael, that’s awful.",Isn’t it?,Michael
8546,Yes.,"I’m awful, aren’t I?",Michael
8547,Yeah. That’s pretty bad.,I’m an awful guy! Ooh!,Michael
8548,How can you live with yourself?,"I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I’m hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.",Michael
8549,That’s Meredith’s cake. It’s her birthday.,"I don’t care. I have an appetite for life! Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That’s Lemon.",Michael
8550,"It’s hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don’t know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can’t be that cold.","You’ll learn, baby. You’ll learn.",Michael
8551,"Uh, boss, we’re out of paper.","Yeah, I noticed that.",Michael
8552,Are you gonna add any more?,Nope.,Michael
8553,For your signature.,"Okay. Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. Phyllis, look at– okay, that’s… All right, all right. You know what? I’m sick of this. I’m sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that’s going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.",Michael
8554,Why not your condo?,"Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we’re into isn’t very condo-appropriate.",Michael
8555,"Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody’s spoken their mind, and no one’s changing their mind.","Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.",Michael
8556,Do you want someone to stop you? ‘Cause no one’s going to.,Nobody better try to stop me. Good.,Michael
8557,Michael Scott?,Yes?,Michael
8558,Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?,"Umm… I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to… the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.",Michael
8559,I’m talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.,Oh. Okay. I was talking about… what do– what? What’s going on?,Michael
8560,I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener… It’s Packer!,"OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!",Michael
8561,What’s number one?,"Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.",Michael
8562,"So instead of working, you want…",Yes.,Michael
8563,Okay.,Yes. Come on! Get it up! That’s what… let’s do it!,Michael
8564,"Awww, it’s kissing its mommy!",Please.,Michael
8565,Howdy. I hope I’m not interrupting anything.,Jo! We were not expecting you!,Michael
8566,"Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don’t know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving ’em free toner, and we keep ’em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.","Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.",Michael
8567,Can you now?,"Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.",Michael
8568,"It’s a little form, says “I did not do it.”","There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like…",Michael
8569,"All that’s just birthday information, Michael.","Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.",Michael
8570,"Why don’t you come with me? We’ll start out with the honcho, what’cha say?",Okay.,Michael
8571,"So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?","We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.",Michael
8572,"Uh, that’s, uh, Guantanamo Bay.","Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.",Michael
8573,"Well, I guess we’re all right, Michael.","I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I’d prefer it if they died, ’cause it’s not right.",Michael
8574,Yeah.,Okay.,Michael
8575,"Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!","Ridiculous, Angela. And like I’m going to believe one of his spermed lovers.",Michael
8576,Uh…,About talking to the press?,Michael
8577,"I, I didn’t know. I didn’t do that!",Mmhmm.,Michael
8578,"Okay? I, I… didn’t do it.",I don’t believe you.,Michael
8579,I swear on the graves of my parents who aren’t even dead yet.,"That’s a little much. All right, all right, all right.",Michael
8580,"I don’t care, that’s how much I swear!","Okay, I believe you, I believe you.",Michael
8581,"Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.","Oh, no, no, no…",Michael
8582,"I think she could… sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she… she’s the copy editor at the Trib.",Oh my god. Was she cute?,Michael
8583,No.,"Oh, god, Darryl!",Michael
8584,"I don’t know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or – I don’t want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!","I don’t know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god… my mind is going a mile an hour.",Michael
8585,That fast?,Oh.,Michael
8586,Yeah? I weirdly know exactly what you’re saying to me.,So see you in Meredith’s van in five minutes.,Michael
8587,"All right, this is just messed up.","No, you know what’s messed up? This situation all up in here is what’s messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.",Michael
8588,All right.,What do we got?,Michael
8589,We’re not going for yogurt.,"It’s okay, she’s cool, she also whistle-blew.",Michael
8590,"Guys, I couldn’t help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it’s as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.","Hey, hey, it’s as interesting as a morgue.",Michael
8591,Wouldn’t we get fired for smashing all the computers?,"No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.",Michael
8592,I don’t think that’s a good idea.,Just don’t say no.,Michael
8593,"Uh, if you turn me in, I’m turning in Darryl.","That’s just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let’s just…",Michael
8594,"Nobody’s going to prison, okay? Um… all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we’ll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.",Okay. You can count on me.,Michael
8595,Michael.,"I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make ’em come to work, and we work ’em, and we make ’em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay ’em but we make ’em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it’s Christmas, but right after they’re back in the thick of it.",Michael
8596,Michael Scott… what do you know?,What?,Michael
8597,"If it doesn’t matter, then tell me.",Why?,Michael
8598,Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.,"Well, deal with this.",Michael
8599,"Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who’s giving me the silent treatment… Speak to me… speak. Come with me.",What?,Michael
8600,Michael.,I have rights.,Michael
8601,Let’s just talk.,I am not going to tell you anything.,Michael
8602,"Honey, you don’t seem like your normal self.","Well, I’m going through a little bit of a rough patch.",Michael
8603,Mama Jo knew there was something up.,"Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.",Michael
8604,"Oh, I hate that.","And my new favorite restaurant sucks… I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? … I miss Holly.",Michael
8605,Who’s Holly?,Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It’s not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.,Michael
8606,"When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I’d break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there… and they’d make a Barbie out of me.","Hmm, hmm.",Michael
8607,"I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it’s all I’ll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.","You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.",Michael
8608,"Oh honey, surely you don’t want that.","I, I surely do, and don’t call me honey. You were playing too.",Michael
8609,"Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.",That was fun.,Michael
8610,I hope your rough patch ends soon.,Thanks. Today helped.,Michael
8611,"Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.","Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.",Michael
8612,"Go, go, go, go!",...,Michael
8613,"That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.","He’s not the worst, okay? He’s not the worst. You know who’s the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. Ah! It’s not cappuccino.",Michael
8614,"He’s got to go, Mike.","It’s just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I’ll look into it, okay?",Michael
8615,You don’t have to yell.,"Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.",Michael
8616,What for?,To get some ice cream for everybody. It’s national ice cream afternoon. Great.,Michael
8617,Why is there a circle with a line through it?,"That means don’t. Haven’t you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?",Michael
8618,"Yeah, but it’s like you’re saying we should bother Luke.","No, it… Yes, okay, right. All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go.",Michael
8619,Don’t don’t bother Luke. Got it.,"Come on. Okay, um… That’s as clear as I can make it.",Michael
8620,"Hey, why can’t we bother Luke? He deserves it.",Because I don’t want it getting back to Sabre that we’re yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.,Michael
8621,"That’d be hilarious. Uh, “Jo, they’re creating a hostile work environment. Stop ’em.”","Nope, it won’t be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.",Michael
8622,How close?,"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?",Michael
8623,"Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.","No. No, Toby. He’s not. Yes he is. He’s my nephew.",Michael
8624,What?,Luke is my nephew.,Michael
8625,"Michael, that’s nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he’s your nephew.","Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.",Michael
8626,What’s wrong with a level playing field?,Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn’t even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.,Michael
8627,That’s a really tight argument.,Thank you.,Michael
8628,But you’re comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.,"No! No. I’m just saying, why does God get to do something that I don’t?",Michael
8629,This is hypothetical. We’re talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.,"Well, then, why aren’t you bugging me to fire everybody who’s bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That’s reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!",Michael
8630,"If there’s nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?","Because I wanted you to come to me and say, “Wow, he is so great.” And I was gonna say, “Well, it’s in the genes.” And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I’d point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don’t want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.",Michael
8631,Hey! Ice cream afternoon!,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!,Michael
8632,I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew’s car.,"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!",Michael
8633,"Well, take a look. It’s all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.","All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.",Michael
8634,"Yep. That’s exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, “I don’t own an Ebay store,” so…","Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.",Michael
8635,"Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.",I’m reconsidering sending them back anyway.,Michael
8636,"You get that kid to open this car, or I’m gonna do it myself… by calling Tripple A.",Wait a minute.,Michael
8637,I’m in.,"Don’t-all right. Well, ok, you’ve just committed a felony.",Michael
8638,"I’m sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.","No, I know they fit. It’s not about the fit.",Michael
8639,"Why is this my problem, Michael?",Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.,Michael
8640,"Lower yourself, Gabe. I don’t wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won’t fire the boy.",You don’t have all the facts.,Michael
8641,Which are?,I love him.,Michael
8642,"Oh, God. How far has it gone?",No. No. He’s my nephew.,Michael
8643,"Well, I got a nephew too. But he don’t work for me. You know why? Cause he’s a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can’t come in my house.","Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.",Michael
8644,"If you keep him, Michael, I’m gonna hold you accountable for him. You’re on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.",I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.,Michael
8645,What? I’m stopping it. That’s what you said.,Give me the pointer.,Michael
8646,So you just want me to move it? You’re being totally unclear here. I’m just gonna go ahead and move it.,"No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela’s boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.",Michael
8647,"All right, fine. Fine. I’ll just go.",Okay.,Michael
8648,I’m gone.,"All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we’re starting with account setup-",Michael
8649,"Sack up, man.","Okay, can I have that?",Michael
8650,No.,"Ok, I am going to count down from five.",Michael
8651,"Five, four…",I’m not kidding.,Michael
8652,"Three, two, one.","Give-okay. Alright, give it up.",Michael
8653,No!,"You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!",Michael
8654,What the?,"That’s what you’re going to do, Luke!",Michael
8655,What the hell was that?,I had to do that.,Michael
8656,"Hey, this! Screw it!",All right. Are we good? You’re okay. He’s okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.,Michael
8657,"Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?","Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?",Michael
8658,Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst. You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.,That’s it? Really? That’s nothing. All right. That’s highway robbery.,Michael
8659,"Good. Well, that’s the spirit.",I can do that.,Michael
8660,"And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.","Okay. Wait, what?",Michael
8661,"Yeah, I’m really looking forward to working with you, Michael.",Is there another option?,Michael
8662,What’s something that you…,This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!,Michael
8663,We can do this with more privacy.,"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don’t think so. We’re going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That’s the key.",Michael
8664,Uh… what was your favorite flavor of…,One hour.,Michael
8665,What?,"One hour. We’ve done one hour. Let’s just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.",Michael
8666,"Ok, I can’t count the hour if you don’t talk.","No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.",Michael
8667,"Michael, it’s up to me to check off the boxes, and I can’t do that unless I honestly…","You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?",Michael
8668,Of course.,"Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis… I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah… weird. I think that was … I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he’s a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.",Michael
8669,Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.,"Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? Three hours. We’re half way done.",Michael
8670,We can play something more complicated if you like.,This is plenty complicated.,Michael
8671,So you have played it before?,I’ve played it once or twice with Jeff.,Michael
8672,Who’s Jeff?,"Jeff was my mother’s boyfriend, who she married.",Michael
8673,"So, her husband, your stepdad?","Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.",Michael
8674,Did you guys do much stuff together?,"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn’t able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.",Michael
8675,Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?,"I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.",Michael
8676,Why?,I guess that’s why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.,Michael
8677,Dogs don’t do that.,Right. Why would a dog do that? That’s silly.,Michael
8678,I don’t know.,"When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I’ve never said it out loud, so…",Michael
8679,"It’s very important for you to be liked, isn’t it?","Well, lets not get too… This isn’t a counseling session… Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.",Michael
8680,I’m just trying to help you Michael.,You. Bitch. God! You’re very helpful aren’t you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?,Michael
8681,I just want to…,You are good. But you know what? You can’t help people. You couldn’t help your marriage. You lose. I don’t need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can’t help anybody. I don’t need your help! Am I going to make you cry?,Michael
8682,Just fill them out any way you want.,Ok.,Michael
8683,I’ll have Erin fax them back to corporate.,You’ll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these and call me in the morning.,Michael
8684,You filled them in and faxed them yourself!,Yes.,Michael
8685,You remember that.,"Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.",Michael
8686,Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.,"You don’t make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake… Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet… “I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I’m here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!” Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let’s do it to it!",Michael
8687,Like a month ago.,Really? They didn’t call me. Who am I playing? …Andy?,Michael
8688,"What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You’re all coming to my show tonight, right?","Andy, what time’s the show?",Michael
8689,8pm sharp.,How long is it?,Michael
8690,Hour forty-five.,"Nope, can’t make it.",Michael
8691,It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.,"I can’t Andy, it’s too hard. That’s-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?",Michael
8692,"If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.",Wow.,Michael
8693,This guy’s like world-class. You should not feel bad. I’m asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?,"I wish I could, Andy, but I can’t. I have plans that night. I’m going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You’re that friend. I’m going to see your play.",Michael
8694,Noishe!,And scene.,Michael
8695,You brought balloons to a play?,"I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.",Michael
8696,"It’s nice, like Up.",Yes.,Michael
8697,"Excuse me, are you the guy who did an entire Law & Order episode for his audition?",Nope.,Michael
8698,"Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.","No, Darryl. This guy’s a world-class actor. He doesn’t daylight as your plumber.",Michael
8699,"No, it’s my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It’s his first play. He didn’t even audition.",Are you kidding me?,Michael
8700,"Shhh. If we don’t listen to the overture, we won’t recognize the musical themes when they come back later.","All right, I’m sorry. God.",Michael
8701,"Michael! Shelby Thomas Weemes, the director.",Hello.,Michael
8702,I promise you that if you keep auditioning with similar gusto…,Okay.,Michael
8703,We are going to find a production with a role for Michael Scott.,Okay.,Michael
8704,Yes?,Yes.,Michael

It’s just. You know? It’s weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You’re wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don’t feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn’t joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don’t know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.",Michael

8877,It’s not gonna get better; he’s gonna steal all of our clients.,"No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can’t now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he’s going to steal sales for us.",Michael
8878,Where’s he gonna sit? There’s no more seats.,"He doesn’t need to sit, he’s a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",Michael

8892,"Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before… or sit on it.",This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin’s. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.,Michael
8893,"So, what happened?","I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don’t care if I take a bullet. We’re gonna call them, we’re gonna put them on speakerphone right now…",Michael
8894,Oh!,And we are going to straighten this out.,Michael

8897,He went over your head to go behind your back.,What is taking someone from behind?,Michael
8898,"No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can’t have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.","It was a good idea, though.",Michael

8900,"Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.","Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don’t- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That’s inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",Michael
8901,I am so sorry.,"Oh, you’re sorry?",Michael
8902,I just thought-,What did you just thought?,Michael
8903,"Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-",All right.,Michael
8904,I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.,Okay.,Michael
8905,Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn’t tell you first.,"Well, don’t let it happen again.",Michael
8906,You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.,I-,Michael
8907,I’m not mad. Are you mad?,You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.,Michael
8908,"Well, I’m sorry if it seems that way to you.","Okay, that might help. If you said “I’m sorry” in front of everybody.",Michael
8909,Mike.,In front of me.,Michael
8910,You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I’m not apologizing.,So that’s it.,Michael
8911,That’s it.,Is it?,Michael
8912,Pam. Can you vote for other people?,"Yeah, I gotta get in on this. Hey, it’s cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I’m cool! I’m hip and I’m jive! And I don’t care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!",Michael
8913,"Michael, this is a bad idea.",What’s a bad idea?,Michael
8914,"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?","NEVER! Okay, you know what? Fine. I’m not Darryl. And thank God I’m not Darryl.",Michael
8915,What should we ask?,"Hey, can I play? Why don’t you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",Michael
8916,He says no.,Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.,Michael
8917,No.,"Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?",Michael
8918,"In the future, you need to get Michael’s approval on anything before coming to me.",Thank you.,Michael
8919,"Okay, well, obviously if it’s a really, really good idea, my door is open.","If they’re good ideas, I’m not gonna say no!",Michael

8922,What have you done for me?,Well…,Michael
8923,"Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? This really make you think, Michael?","Stop it! Stop, stop. We’re thinking. We’re thinking about it.",Michael
8924,Yeah.,"You don’t have to point to the fact that we’re thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",Michael

9147,What’s your point.,"My point is… that as long as people like you and me don’t stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.",Michael
9148,"Right, yes.","I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don’t think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don’t, that’s fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y’know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don’t tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.",Michael
9149,That’s not.,Raise your cups on high. Case closed.,Michael
9150,Okay let’s go in. I’m freezing.,"People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We’re gonna do a fun one.",Michael
9151,Let’s just jump in the air!,That’s it! That’s a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We’re gonna jump in the air. Here we go.,Michael
9152,"One, two, three. Not everyone jumped.","Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.",Michael
9153,Here’s a question nobody’s asking: Is this worth it?,"Don’t answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we’re all in the air at the same time. Yes?",Michael
9154,Why?,I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.,Michael
9155,"Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, two, one, zero.",We didn’t get it.,Michael
9156,Merry Christmas.,How’s everybody doing today?,Michael
9157,Good.,How’s the party coming along?,Michael
9158,Great.,Are we over budget?,Michael
9159,Nope.,No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?,Michael
9160,Not yet!,"Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What’s the problem?",Michael
9161,Nothing. Should be fun.,"So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?",Michael
9162,Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I’m doing fine.,"Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?",Michael
9163,Yea?,Whatcha got?,Michael
9164,"All good, Santa.","Well, that’s a relief. Santa’s gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!",Michael
9165,"Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that…",Yeah!,Michael
9166,A party. It’s not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.,Pam? Pam?,Michael
9167,Hi guys.,Hi.,Michael
9168,"Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I’ll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.","Uh, because you’ve been on the Lam? Because the ‘boring police’ have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?",Michael
9169,"Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.","Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!",Michael
9170,"Okay, that’s hurtful talk. We’ve talked about that. You know, I don’t interrupt your announcements.","You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?",Michael
9171,I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let’s just say I’ll be up to my neck in jury duty.,That was the worst joke ever.,Michael
9172,Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.,"Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.",Michael
9173,"Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.",What? What?,Michael
9174,"Yeah, uh, she’ll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.","Hold on, Holly’s coming back here?",Michael
9175,"Guys, who’s Holly?","That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?",Michael
9176,She’s one sassy black lady.,"Holly’s coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.",Michael
9177,I’m not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.,"You know what, we’ll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.",Michael
9178,Okay.,Cancel. We’re canceling it.,Michael
9179,"No, don’t throw those out!","No, we have to cancel the party.",Michael
9180,We can save that.,"No, no, no, we’re gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.",Michael
9181,I bought these.,I know.,Michael
9182,These cookies are fine.,It’s not. They’re not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.,Michael
9183,"Michael, Michael, wait we don’t have, we don’t have the budget for another party.","Well then everybody’ll chip in, it’ll be fine.",Michael
9184,"I honestly think you’re idealizing people here again, Michael. I don’t think that’s gonna happen.","You know what, I’ll pay for it. I’ll pay for the party. It doesn’t matter. This is way too important. People, Holly’s coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.",Michael
9185,Just stop moving your calves so much while you’re talking.,"Well, this year’s gonna be different. We’re gonna have fun. It’s not gonna be tacky. It’s going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It’s not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It’s gonna be cool, sleek Santa.",Michael
9186,Maybe I’ll bring my boyfriend. I’ll invite him.,Okay. Sure.,Michael
9187,"I mean, unless there’s any chance there could be press at this party.",You never know about the press.,Michael
9188,"Well, I only ask because he’s a senator.",Could he help us with some parking tickets?,Michael
9189,I don’t think that’s appropriate.,"Well, then he’s not a senator.",Michael
9190,"Yes, he is.",Okay.,Michael
9191,"No, it has the little…","Pam, no, no. Holly’s coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it’s a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.",Michael
9192,"Hi, I’m looking for Michael Scott.","Yes, that’s me. Come on it.",Michael
9193,I’ve looked her up online… there’s nothing about her. She’s made no impression on the internet.,"She doesn’t need an internet presence, you just know.",Michael
9194,Hey.,What the hell are you doing here? You’re supposed to be in the courthouse.,Michael
9195,I can’t talk about it or I’ll get removed from the jury.,"And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.",Michael
9196,"I’m really sorry, I can’t help you. I’m waiting for my boss’ pretty friend to arrive.","There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God’s sake?",Michael
9197,"Oh, you’re Holly! Of course. Sorry.",Hello.,Michael
9198,"Well, well, well, if it isn’t Michael Scott. You old bastard.","Well, I never thought I’d see your face around these parts, you old bastard.",Michael
9199,"Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.","Why, you’re some sorta wise guy, huh?",Michael
9200,I most certainly am.,"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!",Michael
9201,Unnnnnnngh!,D’oh!,Michael
9202,Okay… Holly’s back.,Hi. Hi. Oh…,Michael
9203,"Oh, huggy monster!","Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die! Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.",Michael
9204,"Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.",That’s adorable.,Michael
9205,"Oh, it’s so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It’s like a party for limousine drivers.","Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.",Michael
9206,"Oh, it’s fabulous. I love what you did.","Isn’t it wonderful? We love it here. Don’t you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. I show you to your desk.",Michael
9207,Watch out for my guns they’re both loaded.,What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?,Michael
9208,"Yeah, kind of.",Oh…,Michael
9209,Oh…,"Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! Oh, I love toy…",Michael
9210,AJ gave me that.,"Well, that’s understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?",Michael
9211,Mmhmm.,You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy’s mom.,Michael
9212,Why?,"Because without Andy’s mom, there’s no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.",Michael
9213,That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn’t seen any of the Toy Story movies.,You’re kidding me. Ahh!,Michael
9214,"No. I know. I was like, “What? Are you serious?”",What a douche bag!,Michael
9215,Get a life!,Get a… yeah! Good riddance.,Michael
9216,We sat down and we watched them all in one day.,Mmhmm.,Michael
9217,Now he’s the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.,Good for him.,Michael
9218,Next day I found him in my bed.,Really? That’s creepy. How did AJ get in your house?,Michael
9219,We live together.,"Oh, you do?",Michael
9220,"He had a little note pinned to him that said, “You’ve got a friend in me.”","Yeah, Randy Newman’s the best.",Michael
9221,Yeah. I love him.,Me too.,Michael
9222,"Hey guys, the tree’s here.",Hey.,Michael
9223,Why would someone hug you?,"Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I’m Santa Claus. Welcome.",Michael
9224,Are you serious?,It’s a sophisticated take.,Michael
9225,"No, he doesn’t. I told her Santa would be here.","Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.",Michael
9226,Who told you that?,"Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.",Michael
9227,"You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.","What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.",Michael
9228,"Dwight’s right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I’m really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.","All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.",Michael
9229,"Wait, what girlfriend?",I haven’t told you about her.,Michael
9230,I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.,"I’m a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that’s pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, “Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.”",Michael
9231,I didn’t know you had a girlfriend.,I do. She is.,Michael
9232,That’s not true. I don’t know her enough to make a decision even.,"What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby’s very jealous of all the attention you’ve been getting.",Michael
9233,"No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.","Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn’t that nice? Thank you very much.",Michael
9234,"Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren’t looking. You don’t think… it’s not possible… that Woody did this to himself.",It is Christmas.,Michael
9235,"No, it really seems like something Michael would do.","Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.",Michael
9236,"Okay, I’m sorry, why are we discounting this whole “Woody came to life” thing so quickly?","Ahhhhhh! Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",Michael
9237,You think this is funny?,I don’t. But someday I think we will laugh about this… when we tell our kids…,Michael
9238,Dear God in heaven.,"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn’t mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.",Michael
9239,"Michael, you have to let this go. I’m with someone else. I don’t feel that way anymore.","Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That’s what Jim and Dwight thought.",Michael
9240,You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I’d get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?,"When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, “Michael, I love you, but I can’t do this.” But then, with this other guy, you don’t have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.",Michael
9241,"Michael, I’m sorry.",And we did this whole stupid party for you.,Michael
9242,I really think you’re better off.,"Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?",Michael
9243,Just now.,Hey,Michael
9244,"Just now. Hey, Michael.","Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.",Michael
9245,Pleased to see you. Thank you.,Good trip down?,Michael
9246,"Yeah, it was great.","Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.",Michael
9247,"Michael, wait!","Oh, hey, hey, no, don’t run. You’re gonna slip.",Michael
9248,That’s good advice.,"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",Michael
9249,That’s a sad story.,"Yeah, well, at least he was married.",Michael
9250,"Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything’s gonna be okay.","No, it’s not. It’s not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.",Michael
9251,"I shouldn’t tell you this, but… AJ won’t commit to Holly. And she’s gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose to her by the end of the year, it’s over.",Really?,Michael
9252,"Really. And I don’t know about you, but I don’t know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?",No.,Michael
9253,So just be patient.,"Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don’t want you to fall.",Michael
9254,"Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You’re re-gifting this to me.","No, that’s not… no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.",Michael
9255,"Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.",From the mall. That…,Michael
9256,This is a fast food receipt from April.,"Well, that…",Michael
9257,"Hey, Mike.",Hey.,Michael
9258,We wanted to give you something.,Oh.,Michael
9259,Merry Christmas.,Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.,Michael
9260,You’re welcome.,"Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn’t he say that?",Michael
9261,Yeah.,I think I know where he is.,Michael
9262,A trampoline…,Mmhmm.,Michael
9263,Video games.,Video games.,Michael
9264,A DSi.,A DSi?,Michael
9265,A horse.,A horse.,Michael
9266,A pool.,"You, are you sure you don’t want a pony? You want a real horse?",Michael
9267,Yes.,All right. You have to pick up after them.,Michael
9268,"Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it’s snot. I am so sorry.","Okay, so killing yourself. I was just thinking about snot.",Michael
9269,"Okay, champagne.",Happy.,Michael
9270,Sponge.,Sad. To soak up my tears.,Michael
9271,Gummi bears and gummi worms.,"Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.",Michael
9272,Ukulele’s happy?,"Sad, something to break.",Michael
9273,Chocolates.,"For you, job well done.",Michael
9274,Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.,Both sad.,Michael
9275,And did you get the tickets?,"I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly’s favorite. I hope she doesn’t call us up on stage. That would suck. “Hey, you think you can do my job better?” I don’t know. “What’s your name?” Michael.",Michael
9276,"Oh, hey, guys! I’d like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year’s resolution board.",Shaaa-shut up. Hello.,Michael
9277,What happened? Is there a ring?,So… high five me. We’re back. To a happy… look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?,Michael
9278,They’re warm.,"They’re so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put ‘er there. Give me a good firm… ooh! That’s a good firm handshake. You’re hired! Yes, let’s get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.",Michael
9279,"Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can’t keep those mittens on forever.","Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.",Michael
9280,Wow.,Oh my God! That’s it! That’s it!,Michael
9281,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, calm down, breathe.",I’m trying!,Michael
9282,I said breathe!,I’m trying!,Michael
9283,"Wait a second, are you listening to music?",What?,Michael
9284,Shut that off!,I’m not listening to music!,Michael
9285,"Fine, just go crazy for a little while! Lookin’ good! You’re lookin’ good. Oh, I gotcha! I gotcha! I’m pulling you back! Michael dance off!","Go! Oh, that’s nice.",Michael

9295,I don’t think so.,"When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?",Michael
9296,No.,But you did still love him.,Michael
9297,I’m not… I’m not going to have…,Do you love him now?,Michael
9298,No! Just talk to her.,"No. She’d just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. Oh, hi friend! Blegh.",Michael
9299,"I’ll talk to her, Michael.",You think she’d talk to you?,Michael
9300,Why wouldn’t she?,That’s true. She’s really nice. She’d talk to anybody. Why don’t you bring Erin to balance you out?,Michael
9301,"One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.",Or sooner.,Michael
9302,Yeah.,That’s not a joke.,Michael
9303,"Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that’s fine.",Is it?,Michael
9304,"Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I’ll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.","Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.",Michael
9305,Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.,"What is wrong with you people? Can’t you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing’s stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!",Michael

9319,You were super mean.,It was insensitive and I am sorry.,Michael
9320,"It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn’t be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.","I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies… I… care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.",Michael

9438,Okay.,Never.,Michael
9439,You said you would.,"I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can’t stop. You don’t what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.",Michael
9440,"Number two: You’re desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You’re at an age where your sexual climaxes aren’t as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.","Yes, it was that. It’s that one.",Michael
9441,Give me all your money and take off your clothes.,We’re not supposed to PDA.,Michael
9442,Come one. Nobody’s looking. What’s wrong?,I haven’t thought about you having to go back to Nashua.,Michael
9443,Maybe we didn’t want to think about it. We can make it work. We’ll date long-distance.,That’s what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How’s this gonna be any different?,Michael
9444,We weren’t in love last time.,I was in love with you.,Michael
9445,I’m not saying it won’t be hard. But we can make it work. That’s what she said.,...,Michael
9446,Hey. Hey. Come on. You’re hurting him.,It’s like a time bomb…,Michael

9464,"Better luck next time, pal.","Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine’s Day present that a person could receive.

9527,Nice! We got burned!,"You did! You got burned, because Packer’s back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he’s probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.",Michael

9550,Don’t give up on me.,I won’t.,Michael
9551,I got a lot of numbers here to put together.,"Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.",Michael
9552,"That’s silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.","Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn’t be apologizing to Packer. That doesn’t make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.",Michael
9553,"Well, like I said, I wasn’t offended, but I’ll stand here for the big show.","Kevin, do you accept the apology?",Michael
9554,"Don’t do it Kevin, that’s the fake kind of apology.","Okay, go back to the annex.",Michael

9560,"It wasn’t my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.",You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.,Michael

9563,"Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!",Well… I don’t know if that’s a good idea.,Michael

10793,"Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.","You mean, like a ham?",Dwight

11699,Lay it on me.,Three demerits and you’ll receive a citation.,Dwight
11700,Now that sounds serious.,"Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you’re looking at a violation. Four of those and you’ll receive a verbal warning.

11708,Question. Won’t that interfere with your other task forces?,"Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know… I know what you’re thinking. Won’t that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don’t you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?",Dwight
11709,Phallus?,"Phyllis, sorry. I’ve got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.",Dwight

11717,I have to know whether you’re serious or not.,I wish I could menstruate.,Dwight

11919,Who knows?,Return it! Return it now!,Dwight
11920,Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin’ multiple reams like a man.,"Y… You don’t understand. If… okay, if this makes the difference, I’m gonna tell it that you were responsible.",Dwight

11988,"You know, I’ve just realized, this is Pam’s and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel.

12011,"I’m talking about Angela, okay? Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?","Yes, I did, ‘cept I don’t think she means it.

12017,"I need some advice. I’ve been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we’ve been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck.

12035,Are you kidding me?,No communication with the outside world Jim.,Dwight
12036,"Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother’s new baby on it, so…","Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot.",Dwight
12037,"Follow me, come here. Here’s what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.",Or real bombs.,Dwight

12071,"This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets.

13309,How can you eat like that?,I’m ravenous after a night of love making. You?,Dwight
13310,"Yeah, I’m hungry, but I’m not going to make a pig out of myself.","Hey, what was she like?",Dwight
13311,She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.,Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?,Dwight
13312,She was from Europe.,No kidding.,Dwight
13313,Uh-huh.,I bet she had hairy armpits.,Dwight
13314,No.,"Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn’t think this is going anywhere.",Dwight
13315,Wait a second. You’re not into her? Are you kidding me?,No.,Dwight
13316,She’s Pam’s best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?,Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.,Dwight
13317,No… you’re crazy.,Look. She’s a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She’s a bumpkin. Pass.,Dwight
13318,She’s– okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people’s teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they’re not scared when the dentist comes in. It– it–,You should ask her out.,Dwight
13319,Hello stranger. How do I look?,"Oh. Fine. Isabel, nice to see you. What do you want?",Dwight
13320,Um… nothing. Anymore.,"So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene’s and Filene’s basement.",Dwight
13321,What?,I’d like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.,Dwight
13322,...,Crap. Come here you.,Dwight
13323,What do you think?,I think you’re right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.,Dwight
13324,"Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.",Did he threaten you?,Dwight
13325,He drives an SUV!,"I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.",Dwight
13326,"Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I’m in the mob?","No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.",Dwight
13327,"Yeah, buy my insurance or I’ll burn your warehouse down!",Exactly.,Dwight
13328,"No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.",No I disagree. “R” is among the most menacing of sounds. That’s why they call it “murder.” And not “muck-duck.”,Dwight
13329,Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.,Lock your door!,Dwight
13330,“I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.”,That’s bad.,Dwight
13331,Yeah.,That’s bad.,Dwight
13332,That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!,He’s right. Cops can’t do anything until a crime has been reported.,Dwight
13333,Shh!,You know what?,Dwight
13334,That’s not gonna happen.,That’s an exaggeration.,Dwight
13335,I was thinking exactly the same thing.,"No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give ’em a taste of cat food pretty soon they’ll be back for the whole cat.",Dwight
13336,Dwight…,"The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.",Dwight
13337,"Wait let’s hear him out, this is interesting.","Here’s what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can’t be openly violent.",Dwight
13338,Okay.,Let him know you’re not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you’re stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.,Dwight
13339,"Well if I’m gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I’m a mechanic with a tire thing.",Do you know how to use it?,Dwight
13340,Should I change?,You’re wearing loafers!,Dwight
13341,Well then I can’t use it. I’m just gonna hide it.,Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.,Dwight
13342,Oh my God!,You’ll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-,Dwight
13343,Hi.,Hello.,Dwight
13344,"If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.",Oh he’s not that nice.,Dwight
13345,"I don’t, I don’t have to have that.","What he’s trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.",Dwight
13346,That’s okay.,Bring him the gabba-gool!,Dwight
13347,I don’t…,He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.,Dwight
13348,"Okay, okay okay.",So we’re choosing…,Dwight
13349,"Yep, all right.",Check out Dental?,Dwight
13350,"It was before, my tech- my technical training.",Don’t do it!,Dwight
13351,Do it.,Don’t.,Dwight
13352,"Look Mike, I don’t know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?",Yes.,Dwight
13353,I had to make a snap decision Dwight.,"It wasn’t a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",Dwight
13354,It was a lot of snap decisions.,Do you know what “snap decision” means?,Dwight
13355,Yes!,It means like this.,Dwight
13356,He’s alive. So you’re welcome.,"Not on the inside he’s not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",Dwight
13357,"Yeah, some of that existed before.","Not the living in fear, that’s new.",Dwight
13358,"You’re right, that is new.",Yes. He’s got to stand up to this mafia guy.,Dwight
13359,Well I don’t see that happening.,Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?,Dwight
13360,Are you saying-,Yeah…,Dwight
13361,That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael’s brain?,What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy’s not mafia!,Dwight
13362,That seems a little far-fetched.,Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.,Dwight
13363,"No, Michael. What we’re trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who’s a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean.","It’s true, he’s clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn’t on the take. Turns out he’s a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.",Dwight
13364,He’s trying to intimidate you to close sales. He’s just a pushy salesman.,And he made us all look like chumps!,Dwight
13365,You suck!,Okay that’s-,Dwight
13366,And I’m not gonna buy your stupid insurance.,"That’s good, let’s wrap it up.",Dwight
13367,Doubt it.,Oh man.,Dwight
13368,No. What do you mean?,"We just told you he wasn’t mafia, so you wouldn’t be scared.",Dwight
13369,What?,You successfully backed down the mob!,Dwight
13370,"So I looked him in the eye and I said, “Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they’re already dead.” I said something like that.",Very close.,Dwight
13371,"Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?",Yeah!,Dwight
13372,Is someone there? I can’t see you because I’m blind.,"Its Jim and Pam, Michael.",Dwight
13373,It is?,Yeah…,Dwight
13374,Do we have a conversation scheduled?,"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It’s not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don’t care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two… I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I’d just like to say… con-quack-ulations!",Dwight
13375,"Wow, that’s… really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.",You’re welcome!,Dwight
13376,It’s a real handsome duck.,"Mallard. Okay, I’ll get out of your hair.",Dwight
13377,...,"You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?",Dwight
13378,Okay.,"There’s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down…",Dwight
13379,Feels good.,There’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down…,Dwight
13380,"I’m sleeping with Pam’s mom. Sometimes, dinner.","…the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down… You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.",Dwight
13381,"Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.",The Nard Dog… what was that all about?,Dwight
13382,"I know, right?",What were you talking about in there?,Dwight
13383,"Who wants to help the world one step at a time? Alright, good.",Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.,Dwight
13384,"Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!",I don’t think there’s a whole lot of sleeping going on.,Dwight
13385,Hi Dwight!,Shh!,Dwight
13386,"Well, I think I have that persona.",Where did you get that mallard?,Dwight
13387,What the hell is a mallard?,That!,Dwight
13388,"Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.","Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I’m taking that back.",Dwight
13389,"If you take it back, I’ll scream.",I’ll give you five bucks for it.,Dwight
13390,Twenty.,Ten.,Dwight
13391,"Dwight, you brought the mallard back.","Well, I had to, I mean… Kelly was not even…",Dwight
13392,Hi buddy.,I’m sorry.,Dwight
13393,A wooden duck?,Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.,Dwight
13394,"Okay, just to be clear, you’re terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage…","Oh, I’m equipped… I can…",Dwight
13395,Silence.,Don’t tell Michael…,Dwight
13396,"I won’t. But, you will wash and buff our car.","Punishment fits the crime, I accept.",Dwight
13397,I asked for a list. …and a clown.,"I’m Jigsaw, idiot.",Dwight
13398,It rained.,"Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?",Dwight
13399,Ok.,Michael?,Dwight
13400,Yes.,A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They’re mocking you with wordplay.,Dwight
13401,"And when you fell in, did you flounder?","Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and –",Dwight
13402,"We are going to make a ‘Do Not Mock’ list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I’m gonna kick it off. Let’s see what I have to put on the list, right? Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.",I don’t want people making fun of my nose.,Dwight
13403,Your nose?,It’s too small.,Dwight
13404,Oh my. That is small.,"Just, write it down, please.",Dwight
13405,What keeps your glasses on?,"Hey! It’s on the list, everybody.",Dwight
13406,"No, no.",Thank you.,Dwight
13407,"Well, you know what? You’re right, Phyllis, but I’ve been there before. I’ve seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That’s the problem.","Michael, please. Stop it now. You’re embarrassing yourself.",Dwight
13408,"Jim, you let Michael fall in.",Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.,Dwight
13409,I didn’t ask you. Would you like to talk?,Judas.,Dwight
13410,Thank you.,"No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.",Dwight
13411,Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?,"Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?",Dwight
13412,Thanks.,"Oh, don’t mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one.",Dwight
13413,Morning Dwight.,Hungry?,Dwight
13414,No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn’t want hers. Because I guess I’m the only aphrodisiac she needs.,Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.,Dwight
13415,"Well, yeah…",You’re thinking of deer penis.,Dwight
13416,It worked.,Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. Bagel?,Dwight
13417,I don’t mind if I do.,K. I brought cheese too.,Dwight
13418,I’m taking one for my lady friend.,Excellent.,Dwight
13419,Brain food. Thank you very much.,Okay. You owe me.,Dwight
13420,"Oh, no thank you.","That’s right. You’re a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I’ll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.",Dwight
13421,"Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you.",Let me guess– you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.,Dwight
13422,"Yes! And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she’s polished right up, back up to her former glory.",Wow–,Dwight
13423,Feel it against your cheek.,I will.,Dwight
13424,Whoa–,There you go!,Dwight
13425,Thank you very much. Now I’ve got it for you.,"Oh… goodness… thanks. You know, here’s a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.",Dwight
13426,Is that right?,Observe.,Dwight
13427,Huh.,Right?,Dwight
13428,That really works.,"Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay.",Dwight

13433,Not necessary.,"No, no, no!",Dwight

13440,"Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.",Don’t worry about it. You can just owe me.,Dwight
13441,Ahh.,What’s going on?,Dwight
13442,Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.,"Alright, move it.",Dwight
13443,It’s like a little envelope– there you go.,Got it. To Dwight. Wha– Starbucks gift card.,Dwight
13444,No. You were right.,"Wait, why are you limping?",Dwight
13445,I don’t know.,Let’s get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.,Dwight
13446,Ahh…,"Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down.",Dwight
13447,Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.,Fire Jim.,Dwight

13449,What are you talking about–,Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.,Dwight
13450,Forget that.,Can I have an office?,Dwight
13451,No.,You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It’s worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I’m keeping it.,Dwight
13452,"OK, so there’s no defense for that, good to know.","No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go!",Dwight
13453,No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.,False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!,Dwight
13454,"OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.,Dwight
13455,"So let’s just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. Block. Grasp wrist as such.,Dwight
13456,"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.","Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you’re not. Ow! Oh!",Dwight
13457,"Oh my God, he’s making you look like such a fool.","He really is, but not for long. Ow! Instep, oh, not again. You let go, you let go. Oh, you’re right, I can’t hold on.",Dwight

I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties?

14041,"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don’t come in if you’re sick.",Uh…,Dwight
14042,"And get your flu shot. Also, I’m going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.","NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.",Dwight

14430,What?!,"I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I’ve ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse –",Dwight
14431,Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It’s not even in the same – you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?,"It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.",Dwight

14437,"Hey, Dwight. What’s up?",Shut up.,Dwight
14438,Should you really be so blatant about that?,"They won’t make me manager, and I won’t settle for anything less. I’ve gone about as far as I can here. That’s obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.",Dwight
14439,Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?,Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.,Dwight

14449,No.,"Now, listen,…",Dwight
14450,"You’re not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.","Okay, I know why you’re saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",Dwight
14451,Okay. That’s vivid.,"I’m going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay?

14453,"Well, you know how I like taking bribes.",Ha ha!,Dwight

14473,Yes.,"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and… getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That’s a great question. I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.",Dwight
14474,"Thank you, Dwight.","Thank you. You’ll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you’re gonna like the call you’re going to receive. Oh, come on. I’m just happy that I got this meeting.",Dwight

14486,‘Scuse me?,"Shhh, Pam. C’mon, don’t be such a right-sider.",Dwight
14487,No.,"No, it’s not. Here’s how we find out. Let’s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other.

14495,Yeah?,"Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it’s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.",Dwight
14496,"Meredith Palmer… Supplier relations. The word “no” not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I’m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.","Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.",Dwight
14497,Good night Andy.,Good night.,Dwight
14498,Ryan? A little help?,God. How do whalers do it?,Dwight
14499,"I’ll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.",Steak. Rare.,Dwight
14500,I don’t think we have to do this again cause it’s gonna take a whole.,You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.,Dwight
14501,"Let him expense it, Dwight.","I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?",Dwight
14502,"Hi, Mr. Shrute. I’ve waited on you before. I just wanted to let you know that gratuity is not included in the bill and tips are expected.","Oh, tips are expected?",Dwight
14503,Yes sir.,"Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl….",Dwight
14504,"Come on, man.",Winners!,Dwight
14505,"Ooh, why is it shaped like that?","So, you can tell your clients: “Unleash the power of the pyramid.”",Dwight
14506,It’s huge. How much does it weigh?,"Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it’s barely three pounds.",Dwight
14507,How much memory does it have without the booster?,Fifty L.,Dwight
14508,How many L to a K?,You’re really going to want the booster.,Dwight
14509,"Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight’s meeting.",Thank you.,Dwight
14510,"Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause……",Is this really the best use of our collective time?,Dwight
14511,"I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I’m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog…had to pull rank.","OK, let’s look at some ties.",Dwight
14512,"Dwight, anything?","We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they’re out of the house.",Dwight
14513,D-Bone. There you are.,"Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie…? Lick the spoon?",Dwight
14514,"No, that’s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about…",Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don’t see the point. It’s so Wall Street.,Dwight
14515,"I know, right?",Right?,Dwight
14516,"Yeah…um, how is everything?",Good. Really really good.,Dwight
14517,Must be a tough time to be a family farm.,"Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.",Dwight
14518,Oof. What are you gonna do about that?,"I don’t know, what do you mean?",Dwight

14528,Wow.,MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!,Dwight
14529,Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.,"Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it’s still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?",Dwight
14530,Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?,"I can get you exotic meats – hippo steaks, giraffe burgers…",Dwight
14531,We’ll talk.,It’ll all be goat.,Dwight
14532,I think I left my wallet in your house.,Who cares.,Dwight
14533,Right here.,MR. JAMES HALPERT!,Dwight
14534,"Keys, keys…",Stop forgetting things.,Dwight
14535,"I didn’t forget them, they’re right here.",MR. JAMES HALPERT!,Dwight
14536,"I’m so sorry, I think I forgot that thing…",What? Idiot.,Dwight
14537,Whoo.,MIS… MI… What are you doing?,Dwight
14538,"Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?","That’s a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!",Dwight
14539,Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.,"When all this is over, I’d like to actually go to one of Trickington’s parties, they sound like a blast.",Dwight
14540,"Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?",It’s called a costume.,Dwight
14541,"What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?","Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?",Dwight
14542,Whoopi Goldberg.,"Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It’s all Toby’s fault.",Dwight
14543,"Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm.","Yeah, perfectly mediocre.",Dwight
14544,"What are you, anyway?","I’m a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.",Dwight
14545,"If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you’d kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft.",Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I’ve been censored.,Dwight
14546,"If you’re going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl.",Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!,Dwight
14547,"Yeah, she also has boobs.","Yeah, but no nipples.",Dwight
14548,Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?,It’s a root you idiot.,Dwight
14549,Everyone hates you.,That’s really rude. I don’t tell you hurricanes suck even though it’s true.,Dwight
14550,What do you like? Tornadoes?,Try influenza.,Dwight
14551,Oh yeah? What’s the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?,Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane’s coming. I suppose you’re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?,Dwight
14552,Are you serious?,Yeah I’m serious.,Dwight
14553,That’s funny. Ok.,Loser.,Dwight
14554,Dwight?,"You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.",Dwight
14555,Dwight.,Nice.,Dwight
14556,Dwight!,Got ’em. Go!,Dwight
14557,What are you anyway?,"I’m a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.",Dwight
14558,I’m a zombie from Walking Dead. It’s a show.,"Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.",Dwight
14559,Who’s your favorite character?,The city of Atlanta.,Dwight
14560,Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes…,"Sorry, go ahead.",Dwight
14561,Did you need something from us?,Wha…Yes. Your attention. Uh because… No that is all.,Dwight
14562,What do you got?,"Allow me. You’re going to love this. Ugh…should’ve used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else’s work.",Dwight
14563,Sounds controversial.,Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?,Dwight
14564,Do not go there! You’re the deuce I never want to drop.,"Well, I can make this work. I’ll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.",Dwight
14565,Go do the voodoo that you do so well.,I will do my voodoo.,Dwight
14566,"And I’d like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call…Dwight…",The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you’re out.,Dwight
14567,"If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.",Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you’ve ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.,Dwight
14568,What emails are you talking about?,"Robert’s favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn’t strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.",Dwight
14569,That’s not that bad actually.,P.S. We should should kill him.,Dwight
14570,"Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?","No, it’s an accountability booster.",Dwight
14571,Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.,"Jim, you’re trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.",Dwight
14572,We can’t do this Dwight.,Smile…nod. Smile and nod.,Dwight
14573,"Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.","But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.",Dwight
14574,There’s an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I’ll send an order down to shipping before we’ve received payment.,"Oh, there’s one mistake.",Dwight
14575,Dwight’s our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I…,"It’s not a doomsday device, gosh. We can do this you guys.",Dwight
14576,"Alright everybody, you are doing great!","Well, I wouldn’t say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she’s hard at work.",Dwight
14577,"Dwight, question.",No questions.,Dwight
14578,If this doomsday device goes off…,Accountability booster.,Dwight
14579,If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?,I haven’t even considered it. That’s how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.,Dwight
14580,Ok.,How about Scrantonstrangler666.,Dwight
14581,Nope.,"No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha…You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won’t even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.",Dwight
14582,Dwight we got five strikes.,Really?,Dwight
14583,Did the email go out or…,It goes out automatically at five P.M.,Dwight
14584,"Well, th- There’s gotta be a way to stop it.","Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.",Dwight
14585,Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.,No.,Dwight
14586,What?!,You don’t deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.,Dwight
14587,We did our best.,"No you didn’t, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. What?!",Dwight
14588,"You’re a real crumb bum, you know that?","Hey, you can’t just change the rules because you don’t like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?",Dwight
14589,"Uh, the man tree puts its penis-","Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.",Dwight
14590,Nn no.,What?,Dwight
14591,Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! Shut it down! Shut it down!,Good luck finding a new job idiots. I’ll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.,Dwight
14592,"Gotcha something. And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-",Get lost.,Dwight
14593,What are you doing?,What does it look like I’m doing? Digging a grave for a horse.,Dwight
14594,"Yeah, do you need a hand?","If you hit another horse, you’ve dug to far.",Dwight
14595,Where you going?,In. I’m hungry.,Dwight
14596,"Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.","Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.",Dwight
14597,"Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.","This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.",Dwight
14598,"Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody’s nerfect, right?","Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It’s “Nobody’s perfect.” Nice stroke, Pam.",Dwight
14599,"No. It’s a jokey saying. Pobody’s nerfect, like I can’t even say those words right. Ha.","I hadn’t heard that before, that’s, that’s funny.",Dwight
14600,You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.,Any specific animal?,Dwight
14601,I’m thinking cow-,Don’t say cow- Ugh.,Dwight
14602,"Hahhh, thanks for everything.",Sive drafely.,Dwight
14603,Yes. Of course. Erin..,"Hey, Andy.",Dwight
14604,Yeah?,"Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate…",Dwight
14605,I don’t think so.,Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all…,Dwight
14606,This isn’t one of those times. It’s the police. They said it’s the worst they’ve ever seen.,Andy I’m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.,Dwight
14607,Ok Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.,Oh we know.,Dwight
14608,You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It’s a pregnant Helen Mirren.,Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you’re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.,Dwight
14609,In this case yes.,No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.,Dwight
14610,No we’re not.,Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That’s right. You’re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.,Dwight
14611,"Okay. Uh, I don’t. So are we good?",That’s just absurd.,Dwight
14612,"Yes, because she’s hot, right?","Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.",Dwight
14613,"Dwight, am I hot right now?","Why would I or anyone else think that you’re hot right now? I can’t impregnate you, and that’s the driving force between male-female attraction.",Dwight
14614,What about before? Was I attractive before?,"Meh… you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you’re at an all-time low.",Dwight
14615,Hmm. I think Jim’s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.,You think Jim’s lying? That’s so cute. I know he’s lying.,Dwight
14616,Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.,Done. I never touch a pregnant woman.,Dwight
14617,"Yep, that’s the Dwight I need.","If we’re going to work together, we need some ground rules.",Dwight
14618,Okay.,Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.,Dwight
14619,I think so. Okay.,Rule two: we stop at nothing.,Dwight
14620,"Well, what does that… is that… okay.",Rule three: Don’t fall in love.,Dwight

14629,How’d I get this long triangle?,"Okay, just shut it.",Dwight
14630,Is he puffing out his chest?,I can’t tell. It’s unnaturally sunken. Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?,Dwight

14658,Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.,"Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home.

14834,"I know what I said. Jim, you’re in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I’m going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye.",That’s it? This is crap!,Dwight
14835,"You’ve reached Gabe Lewis, I’m currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao.","Gabe, it’s Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.",Dwight
14836,Dwight. Hey.,"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?",Dwight
14837,"He went to the car or something, but he’ll be back.",Okay.,Dwight
14838,Don’t you want to see the baby?,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.,Dwight
14839,I promised I wouldn’t tell.,So don’t.,Dwight

14844,"Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It’s not worth it.","Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions… willingly, or as slaves.",Dwight
14845,Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.,Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?,Dwight
14846,That is completely untrue.,Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.,Dwight
14847,Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.,You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-,Dwight

14858,You had something important to tell me?,"Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.",Dwight
14859,Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!,What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin…family baby. Four days ago.,Dwight
14860,"Dwight, I have exciting news for you.",What?,Dwight
14861,I think you’re going to like it.,You can’t tantalize me.,Dwight
14862,"Oooh, maybe I can. I got an email… from corporate….that told me that…",OK.,Dwight
14863,That… you got a promotion! Right? I mean that’s not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.,"If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.",Dwight
14864,"No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.","Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!",Dwight
14865,Really?,Mm hm.,Dwight
14866,"Ooh, me three.","Eh! No plus one’s. This is for competent workers only. And don’t worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.",Dwight

14869,"You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?",Yes.,Dwight
14870,Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?,Oh my god.,Dwight

14873,Why?,"Oh, no big deal. It’s just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.",Dwight
14874,What?!,"Oh, I’m sorry Stanley, I can’t share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.",Dwight
14875,It just feels like a slap in the face.,"I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I’m sure he had his reasons.",Dwight
14876,We’re not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.,"I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.",Dwight
14877,"Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman’s gotta take off his cape.","Good point. But we’re gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it’s gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.",Dwight
14878,What are the criteria for going?,"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there’s an easy way to find out. Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.",Dwight
14879,Mooshie mooshie.,"Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren’t picked and maybe you could just clarify?",Dwight
14880,My baby is not a monster!,Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.,Dwight
14881,Dudes…the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.,OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.,Dwight
14882,"OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I’m happy to hear you out.","Great idea! So why doesn’t everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.",Dwight
14883,Five to six hours?,Three to four hours.,Dwight
14884,No no no no.,Two to three hours…,Dwight
14885,Nope.,Come up with a statement in the next hour….,Dwight
14886,I am…,"I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What’s that? It’s not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that’s all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.",Dwight
14887,Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.,"Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.",Dwight
14888,"Because I feel like that I’m in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport?

14889,"It has been a long, lonely winter.","Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.",Dwight
14890,I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.,You know I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.,Dwight
14891,"Tuns, I’m really sorry. You’re too essential to the operation here, I can’t let you go.",I wouldn’t say that…it’s a bit much.,Dwight

14902,Why is it so hot in here?,"Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation.

14903,But…,"But? There’s not buts. That’s it. You’ll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?",Dwight
14904,"No no, I want to go.","Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.",Dwight
14905,Is that the buzzer from Taboo?,"SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON’T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.",Dwight
14906,Mosquito.,Orientation is over.,Dwight
14907,"So, what is this special project?",Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.,Dwight
14908,That sounds awesome.,"It did, it did.",Dwight
14909,"Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don’t have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. Oh, don’t write it down unless you like it.","Oh, I like it.",Dwight
14910,It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?,No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.,Dwight
14911,"Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?",Yes. What are my expectations for the group?,Dwight
14912,Mmm! Ugh!,Good morning.,Dwight
14913,"I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I’m up and at ’em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn’t know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-",Heeeere’s Dwi- what the-? Oh man.,Dwight
14914,What do you think happened?,"Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn’t me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh.",Dwight

14918,"Hey, are you okay?","I’m fine, okay? It’s just stress. You know, ’cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.",Dwight
14919,Are you sure it’s stress? Because I did poison you.,"Very funny, Jim.",Dwight
14920,"Oh no, I’m serious. I was thinking, “For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?” and then I thought of it. I’ll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?",I’m gonna set your face on fire.,Dwight
14921,Still queer?,Packer.,Dwight
14922,Let me just get the projector working.,Uh.,Dwight

14924,Okay.,What is the antidote?,Dwight
14925,"Jim, help me lower this screen. You’re a big, tall man. You’d be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.","I’ll do it! I always say, “You want something done right? Ask Dwight.” Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you’ll never be able to get that out of your head.",Dwight
14926,I can do it.,Mmm! There we go.,Dwight
14927,"Dwight, I didn’t poison you. I was kidding.","Yeah, I’m gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There’s no name listed.",Dwight
14928,"Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?","Send it to the frickin’ moon, idiot.",Dwight

14939,"Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.",Who’s doing the presentations?,Dwight
14940,"Packer’s giving one. Jim’ll probably give ours, I guess.",Damn it!,Dwight
14941,Very good point.,"Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.",Dwight
14942,"Dwight, are you all right?",I’m great. How are you?,Dwight
14943,"Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.","I got the surgery, what else is there to do?",Dwight

14948,Retail consumer habits.,"Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is… The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings.

14949,I can field this one.,"No, sit down. “Seasonal.” Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman’s only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna… take a… brief pause at this point. Thank you. Oh, God.

Is Dwight’s pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I’m not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.",Dwight
14953,"Very true. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant’s brother, John Grant. He’s older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off?

15260,"Dwight, you will be participating.",No thank you.,Dwight
15261,"Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.","Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.",Dwight

15268,"Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it’s mine now because I stole it.",Gimme that.,Dwight
15269,"Didn’t you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there’s been theft. That means, you’re not serious or… someone’s getting their hand cut off.",You’re insane.,Dwight
15270,"I know. So, it’s better that you pick another charity.","Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.",Dwight
15271,"In that case, you… will have to chop off my hand.","This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you’ll miss the most.",Dwight
15272,"I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people’s hands.",Sounds like a plan.,Dwight
15273,Is it gonna be long?,No. It’s gonna be over before you know it.,Dwight

15337,Whoa! Whoa! Dwight!,When you don’t get out of the way! Out of the way!,Dwight
15338,You feel OK now?,"Oh, better than OK. You know what honey? I’m gonna get you that rhubarb pie.",Dwight
15339,Don’t..,Everybody! Hang on!,Dwight
15340,...,It may have been the costliest decision I’ve ever made.,Dwight
15341,It won’t budge.,I can’t get it out. Try again!,Dwight

15351,Yes?,This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it’s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It’s not for any disorder of the body. It’s for a disorder of the mind.,Dwight
15352,The mind is part of the body.,"Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane… They are now off their meds.",Dwight
15353,"Dwight, our co-workers’ health issues are really none of our business so-","Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What’s going on Nellie? Talk to me.",Dwight

15414,"Oh, I’ll be the buyer.",...,Dwight
15415,"Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.",I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes,Dwight

15419,"Okay, well you have to show us.","That’s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don’t vibrate at all.",Dwight

15425,"Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.",Hello.,Dwight
15426,"Oh, are those your kids? They’re so cute! They could be models.",Thank you. I’m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.,Dwight
15427,"You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.","Look, I have no problem with women. It’s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don’t lie about your shoulders!",Dwight
15428,"Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?",I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.,Dwight

15438,"You did good, Dwight. It’s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan’s not normal. Let’s just go. She’s not going to sell to us.","Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I’ll be right back.",Dwight
15439,No.,Jan… You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I’ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.,Dwight
15440,Where’s the Quizno’s?,"You’re the Quizno’s. Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn’t quite meeting your needs — nothing like, uh, your old assistant… Hunter. Was that his name?",Dwight
15441,I — I —,Hmm?,Dwight
15442,Do what? Get into sales? That’s what I want.,He’s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do… So young.,Dwight

15446,That’s a license number?,"That’s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.",Dwight
15447,Oh. Why me?,"Because you are my friend and you are a woman… And women love gossip. It’s like air to you people. Ugh, God.",Dwight
15448,Ugh!,"Come on in, the water’s fine.",Dwight
15449,"Dwight, it’s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.",I know. That’s not why I’m naked. I always work out without my clothes.,Dwight
15450,Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.,"Oh, I’m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I’m not in your panties, I don’t go vigilantes. Why don’t you ask your husband?",Dwight
15451,My marriage is in danger. I don’t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.,"All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?",Dwight
15452,Something like that.,"Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.",Dwight
15453,Can you arrange a meeting?,I can try. I’m gonna use SMS text.,Dwight
15454,Okay.,Text went through.,Dwight

15465,This seems a little crazy.,Yes. Crazy. Thank you.,Dwight
15466,But I think I’m up for it.,No! No!,Dwight
15467,Thank you.,"Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I’ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch–",Dwight
15468,What about a knee-capping?,"No! You’re not helping, Trevor!",Dwight
15469,"Yes, a knee-capping could work.",No. Angela! What are you saying?,Dwight
15470,You said you would be there for me.,"I’m trying, but what you’re asking is–",Dwight
15471,It’s the only thing that will make this right.,"Okay. But it’s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can’t scrub worth a damn.",Dwight
15472,What? Why did you call me out here?,"The target– it’s Oscar, isn’t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.",Dwight
15473,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,"Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you’re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.",Dwight
15474,Fine! It’s Oscar. So what?,"Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger’s knees whacked. But a co-worker– Dare I say, a friend?",Dwight
15475,"Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.",I can’t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.,Dwight

15477,He’s here.,"No! No, no!",Dwight
15478,What?,Come — come with me.,Dwight

15480,"Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?","What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who’s the father of her child?",Dwight
15481,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,"Oh, don’t lie. I’m trying to save those precious knees you’re always bragging about.  Now, let’s get out of here. He could be right behind us.",Dwight
15482,"Let’s get it on. I’m gonna do this. I might– I might puke, but I’m gonna do this.","No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He’s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He’s my tribe.",Dwight
15483,I got it.,Disarm!,Dwight
15484,You don’t–,Don’t move. And disarm now!,Dwight
15485,"Okay, okay, okay, okay.","No! No, Oscar. He’s a friend. He’s a friend.",Dwight

15490,"Jazz is stupid!  I mean, just play the right notes!","I know. You’re gonna be okay, Monkey.",Dwight
15491,I don’t like your friend Trevor.,I don’t like him either.  And yet I really like him.,Dwight
15492,Is it called red-vining?,Is it called red-vining?,Dwight
15493,I don’t…,We heard it was called red-vining.,Dwight
15494,People red vine.,Where are gay mens’ vaginas?,Dwight
15495,They don’t have vaginas.,What?,Dwight
15496,No. They’re just regular men.,"When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person’s penis?",Dwight
15497,"So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don’t know the end of the word “Philadelphia”?","Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning “Love,” and adelph, meaning “Adolf.” “the city that loves Adolf.” Good luck with your new enterprise and don’t wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.",Dwight
15498,"Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?","What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer.

15499,"The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we’re all going to do Dwight’s Christmas.",Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Okay! Yes! It’s a Christmas Miracle! Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!,Dwight

15501,And that is…,"Uh, Oh.",Dwight
15502,That there are no rules.,You have never been cooler.,Dwight
15503,"Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?","That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.",Dwight
15504,What is it? Don’t touch it.,Somebody’s found the hog maw.,Dwight
15505,Oh!,"What? It’s a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That’s a beauty, isn’t it? I don’t even want to tell you what it’s made of until after you try it.",Dwight
15506,Ugh. I’m not eating mystery meat.,"It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.",Dwight
15507,Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where’s the karaoke machine?,"This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don’t even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd’s Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.",Dwight
15508,How would anyone even know–,Have you ever tasted a Shepherd’s Crook?,Dwight
15509,It’s the lining of the stomach of–,"Ohh… Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!",Dwight
15510,"Yes, he is finally nigh.",I am nigh!,Dwight
15511,"So he’s kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.","No, much better–No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.",Dwight

15515,"Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.","Oh, come on. We don’t blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.",Dwight
15516,"Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.","No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They’re a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.",Dwight
15517,"Oh, it’s like naughty or nice.","No, impish or admirable.",Dwight
15518,"Quick question–Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?",I decided earlier.,Dwight
15519,"Oh, nice. Did you check that list?",Of course I checked it.,Dwight
15520,But more than once? ’cause you could have made a mistake.,I checked it more than once.,Dwight
15521,"Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you’re gonna find out who’s–",Impish or admirable.,Dwight
15522,Damn.,Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as…admirable. There you are.,Dwight
15523,Oh. What are these?,It’s a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.,Dwight
15524,I’d rather have the bowl.,"You can’t have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year …as impish!",Dwight

15527,"Yeah, it’s all right.","It’s a punishment. Hey, where are you going?",Dwight
15528,I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.,But you work tomorrow.,Dwight
15529,"Yeah, I know, I’d just like to settle in and get a good night’s sleep.",But we were gonna break the pig rib.,Dwight
15530,Ooh.,Remember?,Dwight
15531,That’s right.,No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this–off with you!,Dwight
15532,"Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.","Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don’t you want to know your present?",Dwight
15533,You know what? Yeah. Have at it.,Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as impish.,Dwight
15534,Ooh! Are you nuts?,I judge you impish!,Dwight
15535,"Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn’t hit anybody that hard.",They’re not abandoning the party.,Dwight
15536,"That’s enough, I’m done! Okay? Agh!",Impish!,Dwight
15537,What’s going on?,"Party’s over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn’t real. It’s me, Dwight!",Dwight
15538,"For what it’s worth, I liked your party better.","Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.",Dwight
15539,I don’t think anyone thought that.,Jim couldn’t even stay till the end of the party.,Dwight
15540,"Well, that didn’t have anything to do with you.",I don’t care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.,Dwight
15541,Zero.,Damn It!,Dwight
15542,"Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?","No, thanks. I’ll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.",Dwight
15543,"What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.",Shh. Let’s not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I’m gonna dig it out of the trash!,Dwight
15544,No. I just missed my wife.,I found it!,Dwight
15545,Oh! Whoa!,Very impish.,Dwight
15546,"Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?","What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.",Dwight
15547,"Dwight, relax. It’s just lice. Maybe, possibly.",Just lice Pam?,Dwight
15548,"Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I’ve ever seen. You are all clear.",Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.,Dwight
15549,What are you wearing?,"It’s a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men’s suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?",Dwight
15550,No.,"Renters. Ok, I’m gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let’s get going. I’m gonna stay here and fight. If you don’t hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.",Dwight
15551,"No, no. It’s more of a nuisance really. It’s not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats…",To be burned!,Dwight
15552,What do we do about our heads?,I’m not gonna lie. Lye!,Dwight
15553,Okay.,"Let’s talk pubes, people.",Dwight
15554,"Once it’s all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.","Oh sure, and when you’re ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.",Dwight
15555,Put those away before you hurt yourself.,"Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!",Dwight

15557,Is there a volume knob on that thing?,Yeah there’s a volume knob on that thing.,Dwight
15558,"Dwight, are you okay!?","Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don’t think it’s kicked in yet. I’m gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple.",Dwight
15559,"Sorry, Stinky, can’t do it. Too busy.","Oh, god, this again? You’re Stinky.",Dwight
15560,"Okay. There’s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.","Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.",Dwight
15561,"I have ears, Dwight.","Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. See what you leave me with here, Jim?",Dwight
15562,"Hey, I’m in Philadelphia right now.",How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.,Dwight
15563,Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?,"Mmm. That’s a good… question. 300 times… 180… Um that comes to 25 minutes. Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.",Dwight
15564,"If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.","Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh… No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?",Dwight
15565,I loved it.,How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?,Dwight
15566,"If it’ll lead to me being a salesman, I’ll pretend to be your friend.",Then looks like we have a deal… Son,Dwight
15567,"It’s kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.","You know, you’re right! We hadn’t even thought of that, had we boy?",Dwight
15568,"No, we sure hadn’t Pop.","Oh! You’re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?",Dwight
15569,He calls me Clarky ‘cause he’s my Dad.,Guilty!,Dwight
15570,"My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he’s like a serial killer… of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick!","It was his birthday, just turned three. So…",Dwight
15571,"I can’t relate to that, my son hates my guts.",Oh… really.,Dwight
15572,"Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?","Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they’re not even good. Really, they’re bad. Like you and your son.",Dwight
15573,"Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but… God I missed you!","What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?",Dwight
15574,"I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.",You’re being disrespectful!,Dwight
15575,"…And I love you, for saying that.",We don’t get along.,Dwight
15576,Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is… our relationship is… terr-,Terrible!,Dwight
15577,Terrible.,"Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!",Dwight
15578,"Well, I understand, but –","I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.",Dwight
15579,Listen to him. He created you.,"Maybe if you listened a little bit, you’d improve. No wonder women despise you.",Dwight
15580,Women don’t despise me…,"His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam’s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn’t see it, or didn’t wanna see it.",Dwight
15581,"Alright, that’s enough, ‘cause I can say some things about him too.",Yeah? Like what?,Dwight
15582,"Like the time that you got drunk and, and then… Killed those kids on their way to prom!",That never happened. He’s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught “saving treats” from the kitty litter box.,Dwight
15583,So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-,Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.,Dwight
15584,"There’s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-","Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going “please kitty, may I have some more?” You can’t make this stuff up!",Dwight

15586,"I’m sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?",Do you mind? The men are talking.,Dwight
15587,Sons used to idolize their fathers.,Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?,Dwight
15588,Okay Pop…,"Wait, so you’re the boss?",Dwight
15589,That’s Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful… Although expensive.,"Yeah, you don’t want Italian. You’ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you’ll be doing life in Rikers Island.",Dwight
15590,"Well, that’s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.","That place doesn’t exist. It’s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?",Dwight
15591,How do I look?,Actually… You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I’ll take one too.,Dwight
15592,You opened the door-,And you closed it. The boys are back in town. High fives! Ha ha!,Dwight
15593,"Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?",You got me! I used to collect them!,Dwight
15594,Why?,"Each one is very different, like a snowflake.",Dwight
15595,"Hey, so I hear you’re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?","That’s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.",Dwight
15596,"Well, uh… see, you raised it.","Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.",Dwight
15597,"You know what, man? I deserve this job.",Mm-hmm.,Dwight
15598,"I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond… and under.","You know what? You’re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you’re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.",Dwight
15599,"You could’ve just called that an alliance too, right?",I chose my words very carefully.,Dwight
15600,There he is.,"Hey. Come on, buddy. Let’s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don’t compare. When you’re with the R-O-L-F, you’re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor.",Dwight

15602,"I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don’t do earbuds.",No earbuds!,Dwight
15603,"Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you’re qualified to evaluate me?","Well, I’m the one offering the job.",Dwight
15604,What are your credentials?,I’ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I’m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.,Dwight
15605,I think I’ve heard everything I need to hear.,"Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I’m sure he’d give a reference.",Dwight
15606,"Ooh, okay. Didn’t see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.","Well, it’s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.",Dwight
15607,Pass. Next one.,All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?,Dwight
15608,"No, no and no.",There were only two options.,Dwight
15609,"Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?",This is a bus transfer.,Dwight
15610,That’s just a classic no-win situation.,Thank you.,Dwight
15611,So I’d Kobayashi Maru it.,"Damn it! Perfect answer, again.",Dwight
15612,Yep.,"Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond …",Dwight
15613,"You know what, Dwight?",And anoth—,Dwight
15614,"This interview’s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru’d the whole process.",No.,Dwight
15615,Yeah. Star Trek rules.,"It does, but still no.",Dwight
15616,"Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?","Oh, you think they’re my only friends? I’ve got way more friends than that, and they’re all better than the losers who work here.",Dwight
15617,People person.,It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.,Dwight
15618,That’s right.,"You know we live together, right?",Dwight
15619,Yes.,"And I’ve never seen you go to work, ever.",Dwight
15620,Okay.,So why is this on your resume?,Dwight
15621,"Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input—",This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don’t lie. I can tell if you’re lying.,Dwight
15622,"Hey, Dwight. It’s David.",David.,Dwight
15623,Jim says he’d like some say in the hiring process.,"Really? That’s interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who’s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.",Dwight
15624,Okay. I can’t say that that’s not fair.,"Sounds fair to me, David.",Dwight
15625,"Oh, yeah, so we’ll just do that later.",No. Why not do it now?,Dwight
15626,"Uh… Well, it’s about Athlead. I’m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?","I’d love to be in the loop, David.",Dwight

15628,"No, thanks.",I’d like to give you $100 million.,Dwight
15629,"Dwight, you can’t just hire someone ‘cause they’re your friend.",I’m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.,Dwight

15632,Do you want this paper?,I sure do.,Dwight
15633,It’s not very good.,I will pay you whatever it takes.,Dwight
15634,I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.,"No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.",Dwight

15643,Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?,I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn’t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.,Dwight
15644,"Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?",Yes. Thank you. Amazed.,Dwight
15645,I’m sorry?,What? This is such bullcrap!,Dwight

15714,"He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?","God! I just don’t know what we’d do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.",Dwight
15715,"Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right?

15722,"Dwight, that’s awful.","You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it’s all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was “poisoned” by Aunt Shirley.",Dwight
15723,What do you mean by “poisoned”?,"Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.",Dwight
15724,"Ok, well I’m very sorry about your aunt.",Thank you.,Dwight

15896,Is there a reason that we’re excited for that little woman?,"Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.",Dwight

15921,"Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.","Oh, I doubt you’ll make it. Very few do who’ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you’ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?",Dwight
15922,"No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.","Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don’t quit your day job.",Dwight

15949,Colder.,The coffee in Paraguay is colder?,Dwight
15950,"No, I meant you’re getting colder. The correct response is, “the coffee in Peru is much hotter.”","Ah, much, ok.",Dwight

17617,"Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.

17682,You’ve been in the Scranton branch a long time. What have you liked most about that place?,The friendships.,Jim
17683,Medium rare. Thanks.,The real reason that I went to Stamford… was because… I wanted to be… not here.,Jim

17685,"I haven’t heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn’t he? He’s totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him… and, if he never comes back again… that’s OK.

17692,Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.,What?,Jim

17694,"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I’m just trying to take everybody’s mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.","Oh good, so we don’t have to work.",Jim
17695,I can take 3 people.,I can also take 3 people.,Jim

17697,I am going to be sick… I’m gonna puke.,I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t worry about it. Don’t touch it.,Jim
17698,"Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there’s some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just… the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah… the body of a porcupine.",I will do some research.,Jim
17699,"I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith’s life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.","Six of one, really.",Jim

17703,Cause they’re just stupid.,What?,Jim
17704,Yeah… That was um…,"I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh… How it looks like um… I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um… anything.",Jim
17705,"Yeah, I gave him a ride home because…",Right!,Jim

17707,"Ah, yeah. We haven’t told anybody, but it’s going really great. Right?",It is going really great.,Jim
17708,Hmm… That’s a tough decision. Um… I always imagined it with a giant check. So…,"Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.",Jim
17709,Giant check it is.,Yeah.,Jim
17710,"Well I don’t know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.",Bat birth control,Jim
17711,"Not well. A doctor won’t come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.",Which we are.,Jim
17712,I don’t think so.,"You know what though, I’ve actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",Jim

17718,I didn’t see where it started but I saw where it ended.,Gross.,Jim
17719,"That’s not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you’re an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don’t want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it’s not fair to people with rabies. And that’s the point, right? OK, let’s go have some fun.",Alright.,Jim
17720,Yeah. Oh we’re in last place.,"Oh, would you look at that.",Jim
17721,I don’t know I’m really committed to winning.,"OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that’s already been cured.",Jim
17722,Mmm… Yes.,That’s what I thought.,Jim
17723,Yeah.,Right. Let’s do some good.,Jim
17724,"You like it? It’s kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.","Oh, and I get to carry it.",Jim
17725,"Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?","What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or…",Jim
17726,"I can’t finish. I feel so weak, I just…","Well, you’re probably dehydrated.",Jim
17727,What do you want me to do Jim?,Glass of water would be a start.,Jim
17728,"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They’re deformed, and they’re abnormal, and… they’re illiterate and ugly.

We were having a pretty nice day.,Jim
17729,I’m still having a nice day.,You are?,Jim
17730,Ay-o!,"I’m sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",Jim
17731,I am saying… that… maybe I was drunk. Did you ever think of that?,Definitely not.,Jim
17732,This office is cursed. And we need to do something about it.,Conference room?,Jim
17733,Hey.,Hey.,Jim
17734,I gotcha one.,"Oh wow, thank you.",Jim
17735,Yeah.,"I’m just gonna grab some chips, you want some?",Jim
17736,"No. Thanks… uh we’re still having lunch today, right?",I guess. How dare you.,Jim
17737,You guys are together?,"Ummm… yup. Yes, we are.",Jim
17738,"Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, stand up. OK, here we go. Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.","Actually, we’ve been dating for a couple months.",Jim
17739,"I love you guys, so much.",Ohh..,Jim
17740,Hey… you two.,"Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those ‘we’re dating’ things for the company.",Jim

17742,Uh huh.,"Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or…?",Jim
17743,Let’s just wait and see what happens. You know?,What?,Jim
17744,Let’s just wait.,"Oh, OK.",Jim
17745,OK.,Great.,Jim
17746,No..,"Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.",Jim
17747,"No, they have been dating for like two years. Since before your barbeque.",Wait. What? You knew? And you didn’t say anything?,Jim
17748,You didn’t say anything to me?,Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.,Jim
17749,"Sorry, I didn’t know you guys were in here.","Oh no, we’re just sitting here.",Jim
17750,OK.,OK.,Jim
17751,"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like “where’s the Beef?” Yeah.","Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.",Jim
17752,Hi.,"Hey, Amy. How ya doing?",Jim

Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?,Jim
17763,That’s ridiculous. I’m not going to be beaten by a website.,Actually it sounds like you are.,Jim
17764,"And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.",Or zipadeedoodaah.,Jim
17765,"Ehh, can’t do that. Really hard for me to let things go.",I was… mocking.,Jim

17771,You tell me.,Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.,Jim
17772,So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.,Sure we’ll go.,Jim

18139,"Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.",A formal warning…,Jim
18140,"It’s actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.","I’m sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn’t mean to go over your head.",Jim
18141,"This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.","I’m sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I’m not sure what’s really…",Jim

18149,"Because he’s mean. He’s, he’s like a really mean-spirited guy. He talks about how gay Oscar is…",Mm-hmm.,Jim
18150,"And that Angela’s a midget, and that your chin is too big.",Hey.,Jim
18151,"I know, I know. I think it’s tiny. I think it’s too small if anything. And that your glasses make you look ugly.",She’s never worn these glasses before.,Jim
18152,"It’s complicated, Pam. I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.","Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him. And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.",Jim
18153,"Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.",And no one cared.,Jim
18154,But now it’s being looked at as more of a productivity issue.,Productivity? My numbers are good.,Jim

18163,"I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.","Oh, I like you.",Jim

18207,I don’t want her to get away.,"I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and… Look, all I’m saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.",Jim
18208,"Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can’t…","Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.",Jim

18211,I did it!,What’d you do?,Jim

18307,Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?,"You know, it’s weird. It’s practically a shot for shot remake.",Jim
18308,"Really? Huh, that’s cool.",Story’s kinda bland. It’s about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.,Jim
18309,None of your business.,So I guess I can assume that was personal.,Jim
18310,Fine.,So maybe you’re not completely ethical after all.,Jim

18334,"And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?","Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I’m just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe.",Jim

I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There’s a point there. But what is the point?

18780,"Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.","No, I did that before, it added nothing.",Jim
18781,Close them.,Okay.,Jim
18782,"Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?",I am not gonna do this.,Jim
18783,Obviously.,"And you are not going to, either.",Jim
18784,"Oh, agreed, mmm, except…","Here’s the thing. What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary. Because they’re set up to do that kind of thing.",Jim
18785,Jim.,Hey.,Jim
18786,what are you doing?,"Nothing, just talking.",Jim
18787,"Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?",I didn’t… no.,Jim
18788,"No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?","I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.",Jim

18805,"What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?","Uh, no. Nope. Not really.",Jim
18806,"Well, it’s not for everybody I suppose.",It’s ’cause I’m more of a player.,Jim

18808,"Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. ‘Cause you never, ever talk about it.",Well I do.,Jim
18809,Wow.,I play.,Jim
18810,You can be so modest sometimes.,"Well, maybe you should get back to work.",Jim
18811,Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.,Maybe we will someday.,Jim
18812,Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.,Yeah.,Jim
18813,"Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.",Let’s… eh… see ya.,Jim
18814,Miner –,"Oh, there he goes.",Jim

18821,"Okay, striker, huh?",Striker!,Jim
18822,Let’s see what you got in those legs!,Alright! Let’s do it.,Jim
18823,"Alright. No, no, no. That’s supposed to be the kickoff.",Kickoff. My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. Alright!,Jim
18824,"Why’d you duck, Jim?",What?,Jim
18825,"Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?","Okay, I’m just gonna go get some ice.",Jim
18826,Does that make you feel better? Huh?,"I’m sorry, Phyllis.",Jim
18827,So. I thought we could take the customer on a… Then. Then we could…,"You realize you’re not actually talking to me, right?",Jim
18828,"Hey Jim can I get a, um-",Hi!,Jim
18829,"Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.",Sure!,Jim
18830,Yeah.,Okay.,Jim
18831,As soon as possible.,Okay.,Jim
18832,Just get it right.,"Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I’m gonna dive in. To the rundown. I’ll be exhausted ’cause it’s like a triathlon. Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?",Jim
18833,Use it in a sentence.,"“Uh, can you get this rundown for me?”",Jim
18834,Try another sentence.,“This rundown better be really good”?,Jim
18835,I don’t know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.,Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.,Jim
18836,Why don’t you just ask him–,"No. I can’t. It was like, hours ago.",Jim
18837,You started on that rundown yet?,"Oh, this is just something I’m taking a break with.",Jim
18838,Oh.,"I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.",Jim
18839,"Okay, great.","Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you’re looking for ?",Jim
18840,Just keep it simple.,Keeping it simple -that’s what I’m doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.,Jim
18841,You’re working hard? On this?,No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.,Jim
18842,Right. I mean why work harder than you should.,"No, I….",Jim
18843,No thanks.,Hey!,Jim
18844,Hey I’m here to see Charles.,Okay.,Jim
18845,Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.,Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?,Jim
18846,Do I need to?,"No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my…?",Jim
18847,What’s that?,The one I have. I’ll use the one I have.,Jim
18848,The timeline’s messy.,"Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.",Jim
18849,Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.,"I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?",Jim
18850,What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?,I think she just didn’t want a crucifix cake.,Jim
18851,It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.,Am I going down a road?,Jim
18852,"When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.","It’s so scary how right the things you’re saying are. And you’re coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.",Jim
18853,‘Noishe.’,-I just don’t know if I can do it.,Jim
18854,"That’s interesting, because I hear what you’re saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I’m like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I’m so happy. I’m so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?","It’s just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I’m pretty emotionally needy.",Jim
18855,"And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. Ah, what’d you do that for?",You know that I was doin’ this.,Jim
18856,Totally.,Okay.,Jim
18857,"Hey, Jim.",I just totally blew a sales call.,Jim
18858,"Bro, I do that all the time.","Yeah, well, with you it’s different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!",Jim
18859,"Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?","Why? When I look in the mirror, I don’t like the face that looks back.",Jim
18860,"Well, so what? Your body’s a ten.",Forget it.,Jim
18861,Jim.,I said forget it.,Jim
18862,"Okay, okay.","Oh, God.",Jim
18863,"Hey, guys.",Hey.,Jim
18864,"Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin’ here?","Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.",Jim
18865,"Uh, that’s not what was-","And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don’t think you’re ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.",Jim
18866,"Don’t think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.","When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.",Jim
18867,"I don’t think so, Andy.",Sorry. Her day.,Jim
18868,"Hey, bud.",Are they looking at me?,Jim
18869,Who?,Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.,Jim
18870,Are you sure?,"Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!",Jim
18871,"Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?","Oh, they’re my client.",Jim
18872,"Would you let Charles know that David is here, please? Jim, hey.","Hey, David.",Jim
18873,I say we fill Michael’s office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor.,Really? Does he do good work or–,Jim
18874,Yeah.,Hey. I saw you called.,Jim
18875,We have maybe a month. I don’t know what I’m gonna do.,"Oh, yeah, well don’t worry about it. We’ll figure it out. We’ll be okay.",Jim
18876,That’s what Michael said.,"Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay. Oh, that’s my new “Dwight” ring.",Jim
18877,I like it.,"Good, right? Hello.",Jim
18878,"Idiot, we’re starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way.","Oh, okay. Don’t worry about it.",Jim
18879,"Yes. Yes, I was gonna say the same thing. We should buy him out.","Oh, but you didn’t.",Jim
18880,"Jim, you’re– you’re pretty close with him. You think they’d be up for hearing an offer?","Oh, I don’t know. You know, they’ve taken a good deal of clients, so–",Jim
18881,Yeah.,I mean I guess– I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.,Jim
18882,"No, Jim… I think you should go.","Okay, so I’ll be back in, um– back in a bit.",Jim
18883,Hmm?,"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?",Jim
18884,"We’re not hiring, Jim.",Actually here for something else.,Jim
18885,"Listen, I can’t make you laugh right now.","You know I love a good guessing game, but why don’t I just tell you what I’m here for? Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.",Jim
18886,"Oh, that’s nice.",David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.,Jim
18887,"Jim, what you don’t understand is that this company’s worthl–",Oh!,Jim
18888,No– We don’t have–,Oh! See I’m here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.,Jim
18889,Maybe.,Three yeses. I will see you titans of industry upstairs.,Jim
18890,"Yes, well, we’re not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.",Missed the last part.,Jim
18891,That’s a pun.,Got it.,Jim
18892,They’ve been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They’re desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They’re total failures.,Great work Dwight.,Jim
18893,Quiet you.,"No, I mean, great detective work. ‘Cause this must be the first case you’ve ever cracked, right?",Jim
18894,So how long can they stay viable?,What are your top five cases?,Jim
18895,I’m gonna answer Charles first.,Because you’ve solved zero cases.,Jim
18896,You two are morons.,Got it.,Jim
18897,"Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different.",Can you give us a hint?,Jim
18898,"We’re in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I’m not convinced that Michael and Pam didn’t have a thing going while they were gone.",Can I address that?,Jim
18899,"No, you’re too close.",Okay.,Jim
18900,"No, I’m not saying we do those things. I’m saying something like those things.",Of course. What is like a hostage?,Jim
18901,Words will never be enough.,Strongly-painted picture.,Jim
18902,"No, pictures are too interpretive.","Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.",Jim
18903,"Oh. Well, that–that’s a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we’ll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I’ll see everyone upstairs.",Great. See you upstairs.,Jim
18904,I do? Well–Where is that bowl?,"Hey, you have a second?",Jim
18905,Michael Scott Paper Company only.,"Yeah, I think you’re going to want to cool it with that ’cause it’s starting to upset the other salesmen.",Jim
18906,"I will–no, no. I’ll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.","This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be–but definitely is–a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now.",Jim
18907,"It’s crazy what’s going on out there today, huh?","I know. Yeah, it’s…kinda–",Jim
18908,Sometimes it’s best just to say out of it.,That’s true. That’s right. Yeah.,Jim
18909,"No. IF you do that, I’m gonna do that. IF you do that, I’m gonna do that. IF you do this, I’m gonna do that.","Well, what if I just do this?",Jim
18910,"So hey, I’m want to set you up with my daughter.","Oh, I’m engaged to Pam.",Jim
18911,I thought you were gay.,Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?,Jim
18912,Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?,Sure. Let me just finish this turn.,Jim
18913,I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.,"I don’t want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan. You know that.",Jim
18914,You’re close with Pam too.,"Eh, she’s nice, I guess. You know what? Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.",Jim
18915,"Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he’s my number one choice.","Well, that’s–",Jim
18916,I like his hair.,"Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale.",Jim
18917,Okay.,He definitely stole my iPod.,Jim
18918,That sounds pretty biased.,You didn’t hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious ’cause his mom drives him to work everyday.,Jim
18919,"Okay. Pam, pros.",Mm-hmm.,Jim
18920,"I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn’t always follow through. Sh–New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice.",That’s not true.,Jim
18921,I don’t need to tell you that.,I think she’d be a really good salesperson.,Jim
18922,"I don’t think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven’t said one bad thing about Pam.",And I won’t.,Jim
18923,"Okay. So be it, then you’ve lost credibility. And I’m going to go with my guy, and that’s Ryan.","All right. You’re right, sometimes when she’s tired, she can be a little bit shrill. But that’s not a weird voice.",Jim
18924,"Oh, wow! Whoa!",Take it easy.,Jim
18925,"Not cool, Dwight.",Not cool.,Jim
18926,We’re getting married today.,"So, it turns out it’s the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.",Jim
18927,Tell ’em how it happened.,"Ok. So, we’re going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.",Jim
18928,And very expensive.,Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that’s great but then you have to invite –,Jim
18929,You can’t leave anyone out.,No one.,Jim
18930,"Ok, just get to the good part.","Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ” You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.”",Jim
18931,Funk is the problem and the solution.,That makes sense.,Jim
18932,They’re beautiful.,You ready?,Jim
18933,You guys are the best for coming. You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to. I understand.,We’re gonna stay.,Jim
18934,Really?,Yeah. At least for one more dance.,Jim
18935,This is so cheesy.,Yes.,Jim
18936,I like cheesy.,"Me, too.",Jim
18937,Yeah. I think maybe I want a “wedding” wedding.,"Me, too.",Jim
18938,Really?,Yeah.,Jim
18939,"Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?",Yeah.,Jim
18940,Okay.,"Wait, should I have left the car running?",Jim
18941,"Oh, don’t get us wrong, we like picnics.","Come on, who doesn’t like a picnic?",Jim
18942,Tell them what happened last year.,I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.,Jim
18943,"No, no, that guy who hit on me.","Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.",Jim
18944,"Yeah, you don’t grab these for balance.",Well…,Jim
18945,Jim. Pam.,"Hey, how are you?",Jim
18946,"Nice day, huh?",Yeah.,Jim
18947,Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest.,I don’t get it. He’s not even my boss anymore.,Jim
18948,Do you want me to beat him up for you?,"No, I shouldn’t have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.",Jim
18949,Listen up everyone! I’ve gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim’s whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?,"Well, I could’ve died, so… I looked it up online afterwards.",Jim
18950,"Hyuh! Well, look at that, we win!","Nice job, Beesly.",Jim
18951,Oof!,You all right?,Jim
18952,"Yep. No, no, no, I’m fine.",You sure?,Jim
18953,Yeah.,"Hey, easy, easy…",Jim
18954,Yeah.,"All right, you know what? You’re just trying to get rid of our best player.",Jim
18955,"Oh, Jim, you’re putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance’s health.","No, uh-",Jim
18956,"I guess that’s it for you, Jim.","All right, you know what? Let’s do this.",Jim
18957,Extreme! Parkour!,"This… is Parkour. Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It’s pretty impressive. The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.",Jim
18958,We haven’t told anyone I’m pregnant.,"Well, with her being unmarried… knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.",Jim
18959,"Yeah, we don’t want them at the wedding thinking Jim’s being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.","Wait, there’s not gonna be a shotgun?",Jim
18960,Nope.,No shotgun… ’cause that changes everything.,Jim
18961,"Can’t back out now, Halpert.","What are you gonna do about it? There’s no shotgun, so… free at last, free at last!",Jim
18962,Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.,You have to stop this.,Jim
18963,Did you hear Stanley’s having an affair?,I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.,Jim
18964,"Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it’s really sad because everybody thinks you’re a loser…",Do you know if it’s true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.,Jim
18965,Well now you can’t call me at all. Problem solved.,You’re gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.,Jim
18966,"Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?","Oh, I don’t really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.",Jim
18967,Women friends?,Yep.,Jim
18968,Not guy friends?,Are you… interested in her guy friends?,Jim
18969,"No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.",Okay.,Jim
18970,"But off the record, I’m kinda confused.",Really.,Jim
18971,"Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like…",Well you gotta figure this out.,Jim
18972,"Yeah, right?",Yeah!,Jim
18973,How?,You gotta have sex with a woman.,Jim
18974,Right-o.,And a man.,Jim
18975,Ohh…,And then compare.,Jim

18980,Can I talk to you for a second?,"So, they know.",Jim
18981,Who did you tell?,I didn’t tell anyone! Who did you tell?,Jim

18984,Don’t get on it.,"Michael, don’t.",Jim
18985,Don’t… get… on. Do not.,Michael…,Jim
18986,"The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person’s life, is that…",That Pam’s pregnant.,Jim
18987,"I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought “Oh, she has a new bra with padding.” But then I thought “Pam doesn’t need padding.” It just didn’t add up, Jim.",Okay. Thank you.,Jim
18988,How far along?,Four months.,Jim
18989,"Alright, alright… you know, this is not the truth, and you can’t fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.",Nope.,Jim
18990,Yes. Jim…,"Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",Jim
18991,Yes.,If everyone would like to see proof.,Jim
18992,How long have you known about the pregnancy?,...,Jim
18993,A week? A month? A year?,"Michael, we only told our parents last week.",Jim
18994,Did you pee on a stick?,I did. It was inconclusive.,Jim

18996,"No, no, I can do this.",You can’t do this.,Jim
18997,"Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won’t talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.",That sounds terrible.,Jim
18998,"Hey, what up, Cynthia?",...,Jim
18999,"Hold on a second, Cynthia.",...,Jim
19000,"Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?",Sure.,Jim
19001,"Oh right, this thing. I remember now. What’s this about?","Ah, this is just me and David, if that’s okay.",Jim
19002,"Uh huh, well if he doesn’t like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I’m going into a meeting right now. I will… I love you too. Bye.",Who was that?,Jim
19003,"Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You’ve given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won’t do anything until we speak.","No, I won’t. Alright, thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it.",Jim

19007,"Oh what a week, God. We said… I know there were certain things we said…","Michael, look I’ll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.",Jim
19008,"Hmmm, that’s weird, that’s weird… it’s kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln’s secretary was named Kennedy.","Michael, did you say anything?",Jim
19009,"Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.",Really?,Jim
19010,Yes!,You will? Wanna do it right now?,Jim

19012,"I never recommended you because I didn’t want to lose you and I didn’t want to lose Pam, and now I don’t wanna lose the baby.","So instead, you screwed me?",Jim
19013,That’s what she…,No.,Jim
19014,"Oh, oh, well here he is right now. Come in.",Hi David.,Jim
19015,We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.,"Wow, that sounds pretty cool.",Jim
19016,"What’s happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome.",Thank you.,Jim
19017,Sign this.,"Ah, ah, ah. Where’s the “please”? We’re not animals.",Jim
19018,Sign it.,"No, not without a “please.”",Jim
19019,I’d like to lodge a complaint.,I’m sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?,Jim
19020,You!,Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So… When did this happen?,Jim
19021,One minute ago.,Okay. And how do you feel?,Jim
19022,Angry.,All right. Did he hit you?,Jim
19023,No.,Did you cry?,Jim
19024,No.,Did you feel like crying?,Jim
19025,No.,I’m just gonna write “held back tears.”,Jim
19026,"Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.","If you stop crying, I’ll stop writing it.",Jim
19027,"Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I’d like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",Michael…,Jim
19028,Yes?,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,Jim
19029,Welcome.,Thank you. I’ve noticed we’ve been having a lot of conference room meetings.,Jim
19030,Mm-hmm.,"And I’m wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um–",Jim
19031,Disruptive.,Yes.,Jim
19032,"No, I don’t think they are. I think the meetings are very important.","Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.",Jim
19033,Let’s do.,"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",Jim
19034,"N– well, to be fair, Jim… James… Jimothy… To be fair, Jimothy, the– ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",I am.,Jim
19035,"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn’t about planets…",Right.,Jim
19036,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.","Yes, I agree.",Jim
19037,"Because it’s a big universe, and we’re all just little, tiny specks of dust.",I just think that maybe they’re eating large amounts of the day.,Jim
19038,"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it’s light out, you wake up, it’s dark. That’s the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",You mean on a weekend?,Jim
19039,Yes.,How about this? I think our goal should be we don’t have meetings unless they’re absolutely essential.,Jim
19040,Alright. No more meetings this week.,Really? You just agreed to that?,Jim
19041,Mm-hmm?,"Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",Jim
19042,"Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.","Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",Jim
19043,"Stanley, you don’t need to answer that.",Stanley?,Jim
19044,"“If you don’t smell this, you’re fired.”","Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people’s time with meetings like these.",Jim
19045,What do you mean by “these people”?,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",Jim
19046,"Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",That’s not what I meant.,Jim
19047,"Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",I disagree.,Jim
19048,What do you guys think?,"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",Jim
19049,"No, no, no, you don’t need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.","That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",Jim
19050,That is not what Wallace told us.,That’s exactly what Wallace told us.,Jim
19051,"It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.","I’m not bossing you around. I’m trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.",Jim
19052,Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don’t we just–,"Hey, David. You got Jim here.",Jim
19053,"Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.",Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.,Jim
19054,Excuse me?,"David, I know that I’m very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.",Jim
19055,"Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?","Nope, not at all.",Jim
19056,Very good.,"Alright, thanks alot, David.",Jim
19057,"Talk to you later– Okay, you didn’t let me say good-bye. Alright, I am looking forward to this.",You don’t have to lie.,Jim
19058,"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don’t see you anymore.",Right.,Jim
19059,All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,Alright. Let’s get started.,Jim
19060,"You know, there’s no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don’t say anything about it.","Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",Jim
19061,"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn’t have to be that dramatic, Jim.",Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.,Jim
19062,"Jim, don’t take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",It’s hard to tell so far.,Jim
19063,You use your brain too much.,"I’m sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",Jim
19064,Sometimes the smartest people don’t think at all.,You just came up with that.,Jim
19065,As I was saying it.,"Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro– everyone gets a little bit.",Jim
19066,Con– you look like a nerd.,Con– no one gets as much as they did last year.,Jim
19067,Pro– you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.,Pro– no favoritism.,Jim
19068,That will not go over well.,"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. ‘Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us…",Jim
19069,"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I’m gonna kill myself.",I’m not gonna let you stop me from thinking.,Jim
19070,"No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.",Michael.,Jim
19071,And then another–,"Look, you have a lot of strengths.",Jim
19072,"Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.",I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.,Jim
19073,Ha! That– I am not known for that!,But there is a reason why I’m here!,Jim
19074,Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!,"No, it’s because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!",Jim
19075,"Okay. Well, why don’t you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don’t you enliven me?",I don’t think you’re good at making tough decisions!,Jim
19076,Ah.,"At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it’s an unpopular decision.",Jim
19077,"Okay, here’s a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!","But maybe I’m here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I’ve been sitting out there, and I’ve been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.",Jim
19078,"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don’t you run yourself out there and tell them? You call it.",...,Jim
19079,This had better be terrible.,"Could I have everyone’s attention, please? I have some tough news, so I’m just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won’t. Now, what we’ve decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.",Jim
19080,Wait. Seriously?!,"Look, you guys are smart, so I’m just leveling with you. I’m just trying to treat you like adults.",Jim
19081,"Excellent question, genius. It’s because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.","Ooh, easy. That’s not it at all.",Jim
19082,Well?,"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.",Jim
19083,This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!,"Okay, Dwight, you know what? You’d be getting the raise so–",Jim
19084,What the hell?!,"Wow! I’m just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so…",Jim
19085,You’re not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct…,"Thank you, Meredith.",Jim
19086,What about a raise based on merit?,Rank each person individually?,Jim
19087,"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.","Well, obviously. Too bad he’s a temp and doesn’t count, so let’s get started.",Jim
19088,Are you making a–,Nope. I’m numbering the paper.,Jim
19089,"It’s going really well, actually.","Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv– who’s that?",Jim
19090,Toby.,He’s not a part of this. You know that.,Jim
19091,Just wanted to draw a picture of him.,"Okay, your move.",Jim
19092,Alright! Who to pick? Who to pick?,Here we go.,Jim
19093,I… will skip a turn.,"Okay, you’re gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.",Jim
19094,Jim?,I was just trying to be unbiased.,Jim
19095,How you doing?,"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I’d say I’m about a four.",Jim
19096,"Oh, what are you usually?",Six. You?,Jim
19097,"Usually a ten, but I’m feeling like a zero.","I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?",Jim
19098,"I know, I know.",We tried to find the fairest way to do it.,Jim
19099,"Yes, we did.",I just– what?,Jim
19100,Come on! This isn’t fair!,Michael’s my only friend left in the office. Except Pam… I think. Is she still upset?,Jim
19101,"Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!",Thank you.,Jim
19102,You’re welcome.,What’s in here?,Jim
19103,Gin.,Ooh!,Jim
19104,"I’m sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach’s a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn’t mind wearing a little less perfume… and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?",We would really appreciate it.,Jim
19105,What do you think? I spent all morning on it.,It is really special.,Jim
19106,It’s just a really important day for me.,"Well, congrats.",Jim
19107,"So… you’re going to provide them, then?",No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.,Jim
19108,Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.,Absolutely. ‘Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.,Jim
19109,"Well, you’re lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.",That’s nice.,Jim
19110,"Thank you, Dwight.",Good-bye.,Jim
19111,"Hey, my aunt told me something neat.",Yeah?,Jim
19112,She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.,"Oh, wow. That’s cool.",Jim
19113,Yeah.,"Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that’s in my brain forever.",Jim
19114,Oh.,Lousy Picture.,Jim
19115,Halpert…,And Beesly. Tonight we’re in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.,Jim
19116,Great.,"I know. We’re pretty excited, too.",Jim
19117,Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I’ll break in the bed.,I don’t like that.,Jim
19118,"Oh, Mema? She’s the one in the teal suit. She’s the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.","Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?",Jim
19119,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. She’s very conservative. So, mum’s the word.","Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.",Jim
19120,Who’s doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and–,"Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it’s just going to be blood relatives, I think.",Jim
19121,That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.,Pretty sure everyone heard that.,Jim
19122,I’d like you to meet Christy Kelly.,"Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?",Jim
19123,And… you… everybody can laugh. It doesn’t have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.,No.,Jim
19124,Yeah. Go ahead.,"Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.",Jim
19125,Douche.,"Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight… especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can’t take a hint. Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do… which was just to wait. Uh, don’t get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn’t need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",Jim
19126,Like… a year.,"I’ve been driving stick since high school. So… yes. For a really long time that’s all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that… I was waiting for my wife. So… I would like to propose a toast. So if you’d all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses–",Jim
19127,What’s obvious? Why can’t Pam drink?,"Pam can’t drink? I didn’t– I shouldn’t have said that. I don’t know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn’t. She shouldn’t because she’s an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That’s not true. I– no. What we want– the real reason is that, that Pam’s pregnant.",Jim
19128,"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can’t expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it’s just a different sensation.",Michael.,Jim
19129,"When you c– well? Am I wrong? They say it’s not different, but it’s a different sensation.","Oh, my God. Please.",Jim
19130,"Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.",Alright.,Jim
19131,Jim.,To waiting.,Jim
19132,That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.,I can’t believe it was me.,Jim
19133,"I know. I can’t believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.",Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?,Jim
19134,"Hey, smooth guys.",I’m so sorry.,Jim
19135,Mema’s not coming to the wedding. She’s leaving tomorrow morning.,"Oh, my God. Are you serious?",Jim
19136,"Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?",What?,Jim
19137,He tore his scrotum dancing.,What?,Jim
19138,He is in my room icing his balls.,What?,Jim
19139,Please stop saying what. Can you take him?,"Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I’m pretty certain I’m completely wasted.",Jim
19140,Your brothers took you out drinking?,Uh…,Jim
19141,That’s Michael. You’re out with Michael?,And Dwight.,Jim
19142,Hey-O!,"Pam, it just happened.",Jim
19143,"Okay, fine. I’ll take him.","I love you. Okay, I gotta–I gotta go!",Jim
19144,Are you pushing me off the phone?,No. Let’s talk for a long time.,Jim
19145,Congratulations.,That’s not how that works.,Jim
19146,Can you come here please?,Is this allowed?,Jim
19147,Hey.,Wow. You look–,Jim
19148,Terrible.,So beautiful. Hey–,Jim
19149,My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I’m five months pregnant that I’m not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels–,"Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you’re so pretty.",Jim
19150,Thank you.,"And who cares? It’s a stupid veil, right?",Jim
19151,"No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and–",There. Now we’re even.,Jim
19152,Where were you guys? Do you know how long I’ve been waiting here?,"Well we are here now, so let’s just–",Jim
19153,Yes! Yes! I have so much joy… in my heart… right now. How do I look?,You look great.,Jim
19154,Jim? It’s Oscar. I’m so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.,"Oscar! Uh, what is going on?",Jim
19155,"It’s Michael, he thinks he’s being shaken down by the mob. I don’t know how you usually handle this.","Look, We’re in Puerto Rico, so-",Jim
19156,Jim?,Michael?,Jim
19157,Oh thank God.,"How did you get this number? Michael, we’re on a catamaran.",Jim
19158,"It wasn’t easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I’m in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.",That sounds bad.,Jim
19159,"Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I’m turning to you my friend.",I’m gonna help you through it all right?,Jim
19160,Okay!,All you’re gonna need to and- it- and then go to–,Jim
19161,Jim? Are you?,And then you’ll be saved.,Jim
19162,"What? Wait, I didn’t hear a thing you just said.",Just and then you’ll be saved.,Jim
19163,"No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!",A- ah–,Jim
19164,No! Oh my God!,And you’ll be saved.,Jim
19165,"No, Jim please, repeat what you’re saying! I can’t understand you!",I at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don’t call again.,Jim
19166,How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?,It was.,Jim
19167,It really was.,Really was.,Jim
19168,"Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.",Frank and Beans. Always makes her laugh.,Jim
19169,"They’re back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!",Nope.,Jim
19170,This conversation has two items on the agenda.,Do we have a conversation scheduled?,Jim
19171,"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It’s not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don’t care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two… I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I’d just like to say… con-quack-ulations!","Wow, that’s… really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.",Jim
19172,I’m sorry to have been bugging you all these years.,It’s a real handsome duck.,Jim
19173,I have recently taken a lover.,"Well, that’s great. Congratulations. Who’s the lucky lady?",Jim
19174,Pam’s mom.,What?,Jim
19175,"Pam’s mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?",You’re messing with me.,Jim
19176,About what?,You did not have sex with Pam’s mom.,Jim
19177,"Oh, big time.",What kind of car does she drive?,Jim
19178,She drives a green camry.,...,Jim
19179,And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.,Oh my God. Oh my God.,Jim
19180,What?,"Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-",Jim
19181,"Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?",Oh my God.,Jim
19182,"Hey, Jim.","Not now, Toby, my God!",Jim
19183,What did I do?,"Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.",Jim
19184,"I think you’re underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.","No, not more than anything.",Jim
19185,"Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-",Don’t call her “the mom.”,Jim
19186,She’s right on my way home from work.,"Then take a different way home, man!",Jim
19187,"I di- alright, I’ll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.","Okay, so we’re good.",Jim
19188,"Frank and beans! So what’d we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?",You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?,Jim
19189,"Bottle of rum it is. Alright, shall we?","You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael’s slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.",Jim
19190,"Come on, it’ll take two seconds.","No, it-",Jim
19191,Come on.,"Uh, I think we should just drop it… ’cause obviously he doesn’t want to talk about it.",Jim
19192,"I don’t deserve this, guys.","Yes, you do.",Jim
19193,"No, I don’t.",Just take the parrot.,Jim
19194,...,"Okay, back to the old grind.",Jim
19195,"Oh, that’s too bad.",Don’t-,Jim
19196,"Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.",Sounds complicated.,Jim
19197,"How could you do this to me? He’s my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!",Who wants a hot chocolate?,Jim
19198,Thank you.,"Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.",Jim
19199,How may I be of service to you?,"I am gonna need your advice I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight’s birthday, what do you think?",Jim
19200,This aurea is a joke.,Really?,Jim
19201,What are you thinking?,I was gonna go with this one.,Jim
19202,Haha! Ha ha ha.,And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.,Jim
19203,I have some ideas about conservation…,Yes! Angela! Please…,Jim
19204,What’s it… why are you crying?,Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder…,Jim
19205,"I’m sorry, I was told I had the floor.",Yes.,Jim
19206,"Hold on, hold on, what’s going on?",Nothing… nothing at all… it’s all good!,Jim
19207,What! You knew?,"Barely, I… I don’t have all the facts. Frank and Bean…",Jim
19208,You know what it means.,Hey…,Jim
19209,Shut it!,Yep…,Jim
19210,"Well, I had to, I mean… Kelly was not even…",Hi buddy.,Jim
19211,I’m sorry.,A wooden duck?,Jim
19212,Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.,"Okay, just to be clear, you’re terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage…",Jim
19213,"Oh, I’m equipped… I can…",Silence.,Jim
19214,Don’t tell Michael…,"I won’t. But, you will wash and buff our car.",Jim
19215,"Awww, he did that for me?","Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.",Jim
19216,Mmmm.,Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?,Jim
19217,"Haha, yeah. Say more nice things.","Well, we went on a Segway tour and we’re awesome at it and Frank and Beans!",Jim
19218,Maybe I’m overreacting.,Yeah… maybe.,Jim
19219,But I don’t think I am.,"You’re not, nope. Nope.",Jim
19220,"You’re not as scary as Book Face, over there.",Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.,Jim
19221,…and then I think I’m going to go to the Garlic Festival.,Wow.,Jim
19222,Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.,I bet we would.,Jim
19223,They have a TCBY booth.,Cool.,Jim
19224,The same stuff you get downtown.,Mmm-hmm.,Jim
19225,Do you like TCBY?,Who doesn’t?,Jim
19226,I confirmed with Raskin Design and they’re expecting the both of you in an hour.,"Oh. Actually, it’s just gonna be me.",Jim
19227,They said the both of you.,That is a mistake.,Jim
19228,You should give them a call. Check that out.,"Alright. Let’s clear this up. Well, there’s actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?",Jim
19229,Wha- what?,They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.,Jim
19230,"Why don’t they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don’t understand.","I absolutely don’t understand, either.",Jim
19231,"I don’t want you to feel like I’m baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.",Alright.,Jim
19232,What are you gonna call him?,Dave.,Jim
19233,No. What is his name?,Dave.,Jim
19234,Mr. Bourchard. They’re very formal.,Yeah. I’ve spoken to them on the phone.,Jim
19235,"Yeah, well… this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?","Yes, it is.",Jim
19236,…and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.,No thanks.,Jim
19237,They are into style.,Mmm-hmm.,Jim
19238,They are into appearance. We are selling success.,…and paper.,Jim
19239,That’s sorta secondary.,Nope. No.,Jim
19240,Why isn’t Jim wet?,I outran it.,Jim
19241,Nothing. Cocoa.,I’ll just leave that suit in your office then.,Jim
19242,"Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?",Mmm… it’s like Michael said. It was some- something else.,Jim
19243,"Oh, you’re payin’ way too much for your worms, man. Who’s your worm guy?","Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That’s it.",Jim
19244,"No, Jim. You don’t understand. Things like this don’t just die. Kids in high school still call me ‘Ponytail’.","No, they don’t.",Jim
19245,"Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.",Maybe if you make fun of yourself it’ll all go away.,Jim
19246,I want to make fun of you right now.,"Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.",Jim
19247,No. Don’t do that. You’re not. You’re not stupid.,See?,Jim
19248,Hey. Who wants to watch Michael’s pond dive? My roommate’s friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he’s bringing it over.,"Mm… I’m, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you’re gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so…",Jim
19249,"Hey, let’s watch this thing.","Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We’re not watchin’ this.",Jim
19250,How can we not watch this?,What happened to ‘Do Not Mock’?,Jim
19251,"We’re not mocking, we’re watching.",That will inevitably lead to mocking. So…,Jim
19252,No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I’ve done this.,Guys. Michael can’t handle this and as your boss I’m saying we’re not watching it.,Jim
19253,No. It’s ok. Watch it. He can’t fire all of you.,What are you doing?,Jim
19254,It’s alright. I can handle it.,No.,Jim
19255,Oh. Did – did you see that?,See what?,Jim
19256,Why’d you stop it?,"Oscar, yes. You’re right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.",Jim
19257,Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.,Oh… man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.,Jim
19258,I don’t think you froze.,It’s a killer new dance move. Do you wanna talk in your office?,Jim
19259,No.,I didn’t ask you. Would you like to talk?,Jim
19260,Oscar’s a douche.,He’s alright.,Jim
19261,"No. He’s a- yeah, he’s alright. Ok.",Thanks Michael.,Jim
19262,"Oh, you guys. Just one second. Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don’t think I can go to lunch.","Oh man, that’s crazy. Right as we were on our way out too.",Jim
19263,I know. Isn’t that always how it goes?,Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I’ll talk to them.,Jim
19264,I want to handle it.,That’s okay.,Jim
19265,I feel like its–,It’s my pleasure. Hello? Well that’s great. Turns out the paper was there all along.,Jim
19266,"Well, you know– Michael and I were– talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.",Pam’s sales are fine actually.,Jim
19267,What table should we take? So many to choose from.,Wow.,Jim
19268,"Well, as long as you’re running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let’s see your six months pregnant, but you’ve only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?","Oh, burn. Burn on you… and a little bit on me, too.",Jim
19269,Please be Grandma.,Definitely Grandma.,Jim
19270,"Ok, there’s a penny. What’s that from?",Penny for your thoughts.,Jim
19271,"It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it.",Wow.,Jim
19272,I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay…,Shel Silverstein.,Jim
19273,Home run Michael.,You set the bar so high.,Jim
19274,"Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who– who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I’ve never– I don’t know him. There’s another woman. And her name is Italy… and skydiving… and bungee jumping.","Okay, so–",Jim
19275,"Well, hobbies–",Stop.,Jim
19276,Hey.,Hey.,Jim
19277,Do you and Pam ever get frisky?,Inappropriate.,Jim
19278,I mean– do you ever wrestle with each other?,All the time.,Jim
19279,Really?,Yeah.,Jim
19280,She strong?,She wants it bad Michael.,Jim
19281,Can you stop this?,I can.,Jim
19282,Okay.,And I don’t support her choice to hit you.,Jim
19283,I don’t either.,But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.,Jim
19284,Mmm-hmm. I know.,I just need some time.,Jim
19285,You gotta do something–,I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.,Jim
19286,How much time do you think you’ll need?,No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.,Jim
19287,You’re okay.,Feel better?,Jim
19288,How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum… and you are attacked by triads… how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch,"OK, so there’s no defense for that, good to know.",Jim
19289,False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!,"OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",Jim
19290,That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.,"So let’s just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",Jim
19291,Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. Block. Grasp wrist as such.,"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",Jim
19292,"Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you’re not. Ow! Oh!","Oh my God, he’s making you look like such a fool.",Jim
19293,"He really is, but not for long. Ow! Instep, oh, not again. You let go, you let go. Oh, you’re right, I can’t hold on.",You two are so evenly matched I don’t know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.,Jim
19294,It’s $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say?,Are you serious?,Jim
19295,"OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn’t even need to be good. Oh God, I can’t think, need more Mullins.","Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they’ll follow along.",Jim
19296,"Monkey see, monkey do.",That’s it.,Jim
19297,Monkey pee all over you.,"That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?",Jim
19298,We have a monthly staff meeting,"Alright, let’s conference room it up! Here’s the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.",Jim
19299,He needs me. Seat saved infinity.,"OK, great.",Jim
19300,"It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it…","Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.",Jim
19301,"This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it’s about murder.",I thought we agreed that we wouldn’t do things like this.,Jim
19302,That is the way Southern people talk.,And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?,Jim
19303,"This plantation, we’re running low on greenbacks. We’re having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can’t pay… – Michael, I can’t – Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it’s cause for concern.","OK, I’m going back to work.",Jim
19304,"Hey everyone, Kevin’s going to give us his take on the situation. Let’s listen up.","Alright guys, it’s a work day and you guys work here, so let’s go do some work.",Jim
19305,Don’t just say things.,"Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to-",Jim
19306,"I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y’all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case.","No, you’re not reopening the case. The case is closed.",Jim
19307,I think Michael may have snapped.,Or maybe he’s just stuck in character.,Jim
19308,"Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?",Both. They’re both worse.,Jim
19309,"Deb, what in the world – do you have the vapors?","Michael, not now.",Jim
19310,Hey shut up. You’re dead.,"Michael, can I talk to you in your office?",Jim
19311,"No Michael here, my name is-",Caleb!,Jim
19312,"No, I only answer to Detective Wallace ’cause I got a warm body in the other room.",I’ll take it.,Jim
19313,"Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn’t officially decide anything yet.","Oh, OK.",Jim
19314,"But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it’s not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well… You know what? I’m sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK?","Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you… today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-",Jim
19315,"You know what? I can’t really get my head around anything like that right now, but that’s great. Keep after it, but I gotta run.",OK.,Jim
19316,Thanks Jim.,See ya.,Jim
19317,What’s the news?,Nothing yet.,Jim
19318,"Well, I guess that’s not-",Well there is some bad news. There has been another murder.,Jim
19319,"A murder, you say? I do declare.",Conference room everyone.,Jim
19320,Do we have to play?,No.,Jim
19321,It wasn’t me. I’m not goin’ down for this!,"Yeah, I want to go home.",Jim
19322,The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he’s creating a different world for our child.,Mmm.,Jim
19323,A world where you truly can be anything you want.,"God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.",Jim
19324,The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.,No thanks.,Jim
19325,"Uh, it doesn’t seem like there’s much of a point if the company’s going under.",But if the company doesn’t go under then we’ll finally have all our contacts in one program.,Jim
19326,"The company’s probably going under, though.",Could go either way.,Jim
19327,Seems like it’s leaning one way.,Maybe we should just wait and find out.,Jim
19328,Definitely.,Ok.,Jim
19329,So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?,Nah. Might as well do it now.,Jim
19330,Bob took me to Capello’s. We got a little tipsy.,Ok. You shouldn’t be telling me that stuff and also shouldn’t be taking two hour lunches without telling me.,Jim
19331,"Oh, it’s ok. Michael doesn’t really care about these things.",I care about them and I’m just as much of a boss as Michael. What’s so funny? I’m a co-manager.,Jim
19332,It’s not like you can fire people or anything.,"Well – who? How did you? Who, who told you this?",Jim
19333,Sorry. Plastered.,Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?,Jim
19334,Stuff gets around. I don’t participate.,Who here heard it from Ryan?,Jim
19335,Does and email count?,Yes.,Jim
19336,Yeah.,I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?,Jim
19337,Can you actually fire people?,"To be honest, I don’t know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.",Jim
19338,"Well, I can’t really imagine you yelling at anyone.","Oh, well I yell. You’ve heard me yell.",Jim
19339,"Oh. Ok. I’ve heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, ‘Hey, look. We parked over here!’.","Well, that was apple-picking day and there’s no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.",Jim
19340,"Here’s the thing. Um, I’ve tried it like five different ways in my head and – Oh, got one. Um, I’m such a perfectionist…",Mmm-hmm.,Jim
19341,That I’d kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.,"Simple data entry, though. So there’s really only one way to do it.",Jim
19342,Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?,You know what?,Jim
19343,What?,I think I know the problem.,Jim
19344,Great.,I think you seem distracted.,Jim
19345,"Yep, that is a problem.","But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it’s really gonna help.",Jim
19346,"Well, I’m glad you’re finally being proactive, Jim.","I am, too. Let me show you.",Jim
19347,Mmm-hmm.,"Let me show you what I mean. Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.",Jim
19348,"I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.",Right.,Jim
19349,"Uh, I’m very sorry… about everything.",You’re a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you’re in there. Enjoy it.,Jim
19350,"Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.","Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?",Jim
19351,The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.,"Wow, what do you put our chances at?",Jim
19352,"0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!","Hmm, sounds risky.",Jim
19353,Great!,Anything else?,Jim
19354,Must be hackers.,Hey. What’s up?,Jim
19355,"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?",Did you murder someone?,Jim
19356,Lurk much? I miss Pam.,I think she’s okay.,Jim
19357,Is that what we’re going for now? “okay?” We used to go for “pretty good.”,"Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?",Jim
19358,"Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I’m not in this for the trophies, but…","You’re not in it at all, because you can’t be employee of the month, you’re a manager.",Jim
19359,"Well, technically, I’m a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.",It would look bad. Sorry.,Jim
19360,"Hey Jimmy, what’s up?",Not much.,Jim
19361,"Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.",Thanks Dwight.,Jim
19362,That laugh is so infectious.,You’re creeping me out. I’m gonna go.,Jim
19363,I didn’t mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don’t nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work.,"Let me guess, you think you should get it.",Jim
19364,"This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.","Well, in an ideal world…",Jim
19365,"In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.","Okay, if it’s all the same to you, I’m just going to take away “Survival Skills” and “Self-defense.”",Jim
19366,I’m going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.,"That’s okay, I’ll do it.",Jim
19367,"Oh, no!","Okay, wait, I was not… I did not-",Jim
19368,I… I… I did not… That was not… How come not?,"Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could’ve given it to myself because I didn’t even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.",Jim
19369,"To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.","Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I’m not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we’ll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize.",Jim
19370,Yes!,Dwight?,Jim
19371,"Yeah, you said “In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.” Isn’t that what you said?","No, Dwight, I meant… Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money. But-",Jim
19372,Correction. It was my idea.,Okay.,Jim
19373,"Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert.","Okay. That is me, but I didn’t order the cake.",Jim
19374,"Jim, what the hell is happening there?","Hey, uh David.",Jim
19375,Yes.,"So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It’s been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.",Jim
19376,"Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?",No.,Jim
19377,Am I missing something?,"I really don’t know how it happened, David.",Jim
19378,"Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can’t do that, we’re going to have a separate discussion.","All right, it will not happen again. I promise.",Jim
19379,What?,Yeah. Thank you.,Jim
19380,What?,Yes.,Jim
19381,"Oh, you’re kidding me!",See you.,Jim
19382,"Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of–",Too loud.,Jim
19383,–the party planning committee…,"Too, too loud. Too Loud.",Jim
19384,"Hey, Rockefeller Center!",Yeah.,Jim
19385,"Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.",This is all we have.,Jim
19386,Ugh.,"No, it’s not “ugh.” It is… office camaraderie.",Jim
19387,Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!,Why would you start so high?,Jim
19388,Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! …,"Three, two, one!",Jim
19389,You didn’t decorate it?,No.,Jim
19390,Exactly.,"We didn’t, because we think it’d be better to do it together.",Jim
19391,"Is it, is it fake?",Pam!,Jim
19392,"Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die…",Yes.,Jim
19393,"What if you’ve been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?","Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!",Jim
19394,"Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?",Yeah.,Jim
19395,Phyllis?,Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.,Jim
19396,Take it back. That is absurd.,"No, I’m not gonna do that.",Jim
19397,No? No! Jim! Come on!,I think she’s doing a good job.,Jim
19398,"It’s insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn’t it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!",I’m not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can’t be Santa.,Jim
19399,Well?,I’m trying Phyllis. You’re Santa.,Jim
19400,The only Santa.,That’s what I want.,Jim
19401,You promised me this. Don’t make me get Bob involved!,What would Bob do?,Jim
19402,No no no.,Hey hey hey. Everything okay?,Jim
19403,Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!,Can I just talk to you for a second?,Jim
19404,"Whoop! Okay, what?","You can’t yell out “I need this, I need this” as you pin down an employee on your lap!",Jim
19405,"Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!",Yup.,Jim
19406,"Do you understand, you forced my hand?","Michael, it’s Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.",Jim
19407,"Oh, do we? Do “We?” Is that what “we” want? Why don’t “we” take a vote on it?",Great!,Jim
19408,Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are–,Who wants Phyllis as Santa?,Jim
19409,Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.,"And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. Can I get you some punch?",Jim
19410,What? Was I not supposed to say it? What? Turn it back on.,No.,Jim
19411,Hey. How’s everybody doing?,Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.,Jim
19412,"You know what, Christmas isn’t about Santa, or Jesus. It’s about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you’re my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you’re our mailman. And I can’t help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, “How could they do this to us?”",What?,Jim
19413,WHAT?,What?,Jim
19414,You are kidding me!,"Wait wait wait, who said that?",Jim
19415,"He said, we have been sold.",What?,Jim
19416,Come on!,"Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?",Jim
19417,David’s gone. Alan’s gone. We’re all gone.,Okay. We haven’t gone under. We’ve been sold and that can mean many different things.,Jim
19418,I’ll call him. I’ll call David.,"No, you won’t, because he’s not picking up his phone.",Jim
19419,"I am not supposed to… Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don’t know.","Oh my God, David. That’s horrible.",Jim
19420,It’s real slippery out here.,Oh my God!,Jim
19421,"Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.","Co-manager, actually.",Jim
19422,In training.,Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So…,Jim
19423,Hey.,"Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.",Jim
19424,"Oh, you mapquested it. It’s four blocks away.","Well, now we won’t get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.",Jim
19425,We found a great local daycare. It’s rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it’s also really hard to get into.,"Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That’s weird.",Jim
19426,We’re hoping our interview seals the deal.,"But if not, there’s always the army. The infantry.",Jim
19427,There’s a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?,"Oh. Adorable, right? I walked in on someone in the bathroom.",Jim
19428,What?,I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.,Jim
19429,Who? The –,I don’t know. I don’t know.,Jim
19430,The guy we’re meeting with?,"I don’t know, I don’t know.",Jim
19431,Hi Jerry.,Jerry.,Jim
19432,Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room.,"This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh –",Jim
19433,"Oh, so you saw it already?","No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn’t like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn’t focus on anything in particular.",Jim
19434,Oh. Got to take this. Sorry.,Do it.,Jim
19435,"Ok, you’ve got to pull it together.",We should just go. He’s really uncomfortable.,Jim
19436,He’s uncomfortable because you’re acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.,What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?,Jim
19437,Sorry about that. Right this way.,All right.,Jim
19438,"That seems a bit premature, don’t you think? I don’t even know if I have a space for you yet, and you’re already lining up your holiday plans.","Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we’re kind of planners. But we’re also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.",Jim
19439,Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?,What?,Jim
19440,Seriously? You told her?,Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.,Jim
19441,And you – you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?,No.,Jim
19442,I’m being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are?,"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children’s toilet? Why didn’t you just lock the door, man?",Jim
19443,It doesn’t lock for the children’s safety.,Anybody could have walked in.,Jim
19444,"Jo, I don’t know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.","Whoa, whoa.",Jim
19445,"Whoa, whoa!","I’ll take over. Um, what we’re doing here: Michael handles more of the “big-picture” stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together…",Jim
19446,Yeah. I think I understand.,Alright.,Jim
19447,Each of you is doing half a job.,No.,Jim
19448,"This is knucklehead talk. I’m not gonna bite it, you know. You can’t give me gravy and tell me it’s jelly, because gravy ain’t sweet! Is it, Jim?",I don’t think so.,Jim
19449,I humbly accept the management position.,I… Why would you just say something like that?,Jim
19450,"Because, well, Jim. Where I’m from, two types of folk: those who ain’t, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain’t you ain’t? Ya’ll come back now.",Do you even know what that means?,Jim
19451,"Well, I’m gonna let this marinate. So you can go.",Um…,Jim
19452,"So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.",This is way more than I make now.,Jim
19453,Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?,"Actually, yeah.",Jim
19454,What?,Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.,Jim
19455,What? Really?,Yeah!,Jim
19456,Really?,Really.,Jim
19457,"Well, I think you’re both being a little too modest.","No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.",Jim
19458,"No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.",Why would you do that?,Jim
19459,"Oh, Michael marked his heights. He’s grown!",Mm!,Jim
19460,"Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? Michael Scott, head of sales.","You gotta do something, man. You can’t just sit there.",Jim
19461,Who’s hungry?,What is that?,Jim
19462,It’s ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say “Who’s hungry?”,"Oh. I’m fine. Thank you, though.",Jim
19463,Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?,Why would I wanna do that?,Jim
19464,"It’s a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.","For now, I’m just gonna go back to work here…",Jim
19465,Oh sure.,Yeah. Thank you.,Jim
19466,Hey.,Hey.,Jim
19467,"You know, it’s funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I’m out there, and I wish I was in here.","Well, the grass is always greener.",Jim
19468,Yeah. Except there’s no grass out there. It’s just a farty dirt patch.,"Well, it’s what you wanted.",Jim
19469,I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.,"For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I’m not really sure what we do.",Jim
19470,"We make a poster that says “Happy Opposite Day!” and she sees it on the way out… Nah, that’s stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.","Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could’ve just gone and talked to her.",Jim
19471,Lethal Weapon?,That’s it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.,Jim
19472,What? What I’m saying…,"Michael’s saying he’s better at being manager, and I agree, cause he’s a better people person, weirdly.",Jim
19473,"Fine. I don’t care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.",Alright.,Jim
19474,He looks happy.,Yep.,Jim
19475,Wait a minute! You can’t do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.,"Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I’m excited. Oh, definitely.",Jim
19476,"I’m having contractions, but they’re irregular and far apart. So I’m not really in labor, I’m near labor.","Yeah, we’re slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.",Jim
19477,"If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.","Not to mention the extra night’s sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it’s crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it’s a boy.",Jim
19478,"Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She’s contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car…",Michael.,Jim
19479,"Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.","Michael, you shouldn’t have done that.",Jim
19480,"Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.","Hmm, that logic’s air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn’t conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.",Jim
19481,"Ooh, spooky. But why?",Because the insurance company only covers two nights.,Jim
19482,"Hold on, hold on. It isn’t midnight yet.",Are you serious? Pam.,Jim
19483,"No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.","I… Pam, please.",Jim
19484,Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.,"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.",Jim
19485,"Okay, stop watching me.","Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.",Jim
19486,Mm-hmm.,"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that’s a big deal. While we’re on the subject, why don’t I just run you down to the hospital and we’ll just do a quick check?",Jim
19487,"My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.","You know, it’s getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day’s not out yet.",Jim
19488,"No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can’t tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.","Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body’s signals.",Jim
19489,I’m going to go look at the Internet.,"Oh! Oh, alright. That’s a good one.",Jim
19490,"For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!","Okay, you know what? I’m going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He’d probably know…",Jim
19491,"Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let’s have happy times.",Alright.,Jim
19492,Stick spicy food up her butt.,"Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let’s go to the hospital. Pam, let’s go to the hospital right now.",Jim
19493,"Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you’re really distracting me from my distractions.","Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.",Jim
19494,Why don’t you go do some work?,"Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled.",Jim
19495,"I know, you don’t like to be frazzled.","No, I don’t.",Jim
19496,Okay.,"Oh, and by the way, hate that you’re helping her with this right now. Totally.",Jim
19497,"Hey. I’m not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you’ll try to drive me to the hospital.","Ah, you know me too well.",Jim
19498,"Okay, Jim.",Yeah? … Oh.,Jim
19499,"Everything is fine. You don’t have to worry. Try not to think about it. She’s not coming out for a while, okay?",Did you say “she?”,Jim
19500,"I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn’t wait… Oh, God, don’t be mad.",Mad? How could I be mad? We’re having a little girl.,Jim
19501,Mm-hmm.,"Wow, we’re having a little girl. Oh, man.",Jim
19502,I know.,"Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.",Jim
19503,Good.,Yeah.,Jim
19504,Okay.,"Alright… Hey, did you change?",Jim
19505,"Oh, yeah, my water broke.",Oh. Oh…,Jim
19506,"Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it’s time to go to the hospital.",Alright. Time to go. Okay.,Jim
19507,"That’s right, let’s do this.",Let’s give it a shot.,Jim
19508,"Nope. No, no, that’s better. That wasn’t even the worst of them. I’m fine.","Hey, come on. Let’s go to the hospital.",Jim
19509,"They’re not that bad still, babe.","Pam, Pam, it’s time. Let’s go to the hospital.",Jim
19510,"No, it’s passing, it’s fine. It’s okay.","Come on, Michael says we should go now.",Jim
19511,"No, it’s passing, it’s fine.",Pam.,Jim
19512,"Ah, no, it passed. It’s good.",You know what? Let’s go. We got to go to the hospital.,Jim
19513,"Okay, I’m not going. I’m not… It’s fine. Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I’m not going today because I can’t do it, I don’t think I can do it.","Hey, are you kidding me?",Jim
19514,Are you kidding?,"If anyone can do this, you can do this.",Jim
19515,You can do this. You can do this.,"Pam, I’m scared. I’m real scared.",Jim
19516,I’m petrified.,"The best news is, we’re going to have a baby today.",Jim
19517,Yeah.,A really awesome baby.,Jim
19518,We’re going to have a baby.,So let’s have it at the hospital.,Jim
19519,Let’s do that.,How are we doing on contractions?,Jim
19520,Two minutes apart.,Two minutes…,Jim
19521,"Oh, God. Oh, no.","Michael, I told you.",Jim
19522,It’s okay.,"No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.",Jim
19523,"I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.","We waited too long! Two minutes doesn’t do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?",Jim
19524,"No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.","Alright, we’re driving ourselves, actually.",Jim
19525,"No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.","Alright, I have my wallet.",Jim
19526,Yes.,"Go bag’s in the car… Keys, my keys, where’s my keys?",Jim
19527,“We” don’t.,"Okay, I can’t find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found ’em. They’re here.",Jim
19528,By the bushes?,"Okay, Michael! Focus!",Jim
19529,"Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.","Michael, come on!",Jim
19530,"Wait, wait. My iPod’s not in here!",Okay.,Jim
19531,It has the birth song on it!,"Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We’ll be fine.",Jim
19532,"Jim, I don’t want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.","Okay, so what do you want to do?",Jim
19533,I don’t know! Let’s go by the house and get it. It’s only twenty minutes past the hospital!,"Pam, no! Are you nuts? We’re going to the hospital now.",Jim
19534,Okay.,"Wait, you alright?",Jim
19535,"Do you have everything, guys?","Michael, just go park the car.",Jim
19536,Daddy? She’s ready to push.,Okay.,Jim
19537,"Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.","Doing great, push again.",Jim
19538,Not yet.,"No, don’t push. Pull. Pull.",Jim
19539,"You’re starting, you’re kinda losing them.","Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she’s so beautiful! Oh, my God.",Jim
19540,She’s incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?,"No, let’s let her rest. I’m sure there’s still twelve on each.",Jim
19541,"Guys, guys!",Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.,Jim
19542,Eleven pounds…,"She’s seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great.",Jim
19543,Hi there.,"Hey, grandma’s back.",Jim
19544,"Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.",Great.,Jim
19545,"Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.",Oh. Let me get it.,Jim
19546,"Oh, okay.",Ready?,Jim
19547,"Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.","It’s so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.",Jim
19548,Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?,We were just kids. What did we know?,Jim
19549,How we doing?,Great.,Jim
19550,She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You’ve been through a lot.,I think we’ll be okay.,Jim
19551,"One, and then wrap around. It’s okay. Hold that arm down.","I can’t. She’s too strong. She’s, careful, though. You don’t want to break it.",Jim
19552,She’s not gonna… Just…,I got it. Alright.,Jim
19553,Go.,Nurse!,Jim
19554,"I don’t know. I just, I can’t tell if she’s getting anything.",Really?,Jim
19555,Doesn’t feel right.,"Well, you’re pushing the milk out, right?",Jim
19556,How does one do that?,Wasn’t it… It’s kinda like a… Like that.,Jim
19557,"Do you want to try it, Jim?",I think you’re good. Doing a good job.,Jim
19558,Somebody buzzed?,"Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam.",Jim
19559,"Well, I’ll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?",Alright.,Jim
19560,Alright.,It’s going to be alright.,Jim
19561,Maybe it’ll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.,"Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good.",Jim
19562,"Hey, guys. We’re short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.","Oh, hi.",Jim
19563,"Hi, so sorry.","Careful… Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.",Jim
19564,I know.,You see that? I’m pretty sure she’s… Hi.,Jim
19565,"Um, yeah, that would be great.",Yup. Really great. When’s she available?,Jim
19566,Okay.,Are you sure it doesn’t hurt?,Jim
19567,"Okay, well. Feel how I’m flicking the nipple? Like that?",Yup.,Jim
19568,Stimulate it.,Yeah.,Jim
19569,"Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh…",Perfect.,Jim
19570,And you can just… The baby should grab on to that.,I think she will.,Jim
19571,"Okay. So, I’m just not sure if I’m releasing, though. I’m not sure if…",We’ll figure it out.,Jim
19572,"Yes, congratulations.",Thank you.,Jim
19573,Okay.,Please do.,Jim
19574,"Oh, shoot.",What?,Jim
19575,"Shoot, she fell off.","Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.",Jim
19576,"Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?",No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.,Jim
19577,"Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it’d be weird if you did it.","Okay, I’ll just go get the other guy.",Jim
19578,"Jim, Jim, get her.",Hmm?,Jim
19579,I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay… Jim! She latched! She latched.,That’s amazing.,Jim
19580,"Oh, my God. I didn’t even have to do the “C thing.”",That’s awesome.,Jim
19581,"Aw, we’re doing it.",that’s great.,Jim
19582,We’re really parents now.,Mm-hmm.,Jim
19583,"Oh, hey, Isabelle.",Hey.,Jim
19584,"Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she’s totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don’t want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety… Oh, my God! Wrong baby!",What?,Jim
19585,Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.,"Okay, okay.",Jim
19586,"No, not at all.",Perfect.,Jim
19587,"Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won’t latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di…",Ha ha ha.,Jim
19588,Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home?,"We definitely are. At 3:00, right? You said we could stay until 3:00?",Jim
19589,"Yeah, you can. It’s 2:35.",Half hour.,Jim
19590,Twenty five minutes. And you’re all set with the car seat?,"Yes, car seat’s right there.",Jim
19591,That bottom part needs to go in the car.,"Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.",Jim
19592,"Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.","Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be… Can we get a late checkout? I don’t… I don’t think she heard me.",Jim
19593,Yeah.,"But you hear the baby crying, right?",Jim
19594,Mm-hmm… Where’s your car?,"Uh, it’s in the lot.",Jim
19595,"Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.","Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back.",Jim
19596,"Okay, alright, thanks… Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay… Okay, let me… Just you and me. Come on. There we go… Yeah… Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.",Five tickets on the windshield… Hey.,Jim

19607,Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?,Is this yours or mine?,Jim
19608,"It’s kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she’s very ironic.",Okay. Love you. We’ll talk soon.,Jim
19609,"Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?",It is. Big time.,Jim
19610,"Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.",Pretty amazing.,Jim
19611,"What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.",Oh it’s tough being here for a lot of reasons.,Jim
19612,"I mean, you’re here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.",Is that what happened to you?,Jim
19613,"I’ll tell you what happened to me. I didn’t see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.",That’s a common mistake.,Jim
19614,"Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.",What?,Jim
19615,My headphones are broken.,Right.,Jim
19616,Can I listen to my music at a low volume?,Yeah that’s great. Great.,Jim
19617,"Okay? “The cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-“",When’s the last time you upgraded your printer?,Jim
19618,“- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don’t know when-“,Please stop that!,Jim

19624,“I don’t know when-“,"That would be great, thank you.",Jim
19625,Hello?,"Hey Jo, it’s Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it’s so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.",Jim
19626,"Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.","You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!",Jim
19627,Okay.,Okay.,Jim
19628,Thank you.,Thanks again by the way.,Jim
19629,What the hell is this?,Oh!,Jim
19630,This is not Mega-Desk.,"No, it’s not. They call it Quad-Desk.",Jim
19631,"That’s ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.",Oh my God. We’re going to have to re-name it then aren’t we?,Jim
19632,"Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. Do you know who that is?",No.,Jim
19633,"Look at him. Look at him – t-shirt, jeans…",Is he you?,Jim
19634,I am flattered. That’s Johnny Depp.,Where did you take that?,Jim
19635,In my condo complex.,"Oh my God, that’s right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.",Jim
19636,"I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.",Sure. That they should do one.,Jim
19637,"Hey, Jim, Jim – where, where do I find the Black Pearl?",Who’s that?,Jim
19638,"Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.",John Dillinger.,Jim
19639,No. I’m Captain Jack Sparrow.,Captain Crunch.,Jim
19640,"Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it’s not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you’d seen Roger Clemens?",At the Yankees game. Yeah.,Jim
19641,"Yeah. Well, it wasn’t him.","I had a little better reason to believe that… You’re right. You’re right. Well, you’re not right, because Johnny Depp…",Jim
19642,"I know, I know.",…in your condo complex.,Jim
19643,I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.,M. Night Shulman?,Jim
19644,"Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It’s a big cheque.","Oh, sorry, wait one second.",Jim
19645,Stop sexting Pam. I’m trying to congratulate you.,"This is actually a big potential sale, so…",Jim

19649,"I’m just saying, that –",Michael – Great.,Jim
19650,Thank you very much.,What’d you get?,Jim
19651,"Ah, just the stupid leads.",Alright!,Jim
19652,Hey.,"So I’m going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one’s going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?",Jim
19653,Mm-hmm.,"Alright. So why don’t you just give me my share of the leads, and I’ll start making some calls?",Jim
19654,Okay.,"Hey, alright.",Jim
19655,Alright.,"Ahh, these aren’t leads. What are they?",Jim
19656,"Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don’t respect the father who doesn’t respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",I don’t think you understand –,Jim
19657,I do understand it.,This one’s a map.,Jim
19658,"Hey baby, what’s up?",I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?,Jim
19659,Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.,"Oh my god, I couldn’t envy you more.",Jim
19660,"He means his mopey place, it’s under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.",I love you.,Jim
19661,"What are you doing, idiot?",Michael’s stupid scavenger hunt.,Jim
19662,Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. ‘The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.’,Lincoln.,Jim
19663,The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.,It involves you too.,Jim
19664,"You’re adorable. You need to go for it. I’m going to be, like, mad at you if you don’t –",Phew! Can’t wait for this day to be over.,Jim
19665,Why?,Just all the – drama.,Jim
19666,What drama?,"Between the – us and you guys. It’s unnecessary, right?",Jim
19667,So unnecessary.,"Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that.",Jim
19668,"I mean, if the salesmen weren’t acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn’t be so bad – did you ever think of that?",I have new baby pictures.,Jim
19669,Don’t use your cute baby to make us like you.,She’s wearing a onesie,Jim
19670,"If we act nice now, then we’re rewarding them for treating us poorly.",Didn’t we kind of start it?,Jim
19671,"I don’t know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company’s changed, and if they don’t like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.","Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?",Jim
19672,"All those who agree, say aye All those opposed –",I don’t think we need opposed.,Jim
19673,What’s the least we can do to make this okay?,I’ll text Pam. She’s really good at this stuff.,Jim
19674,That is a dangerous precedent.,Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.,Jim
19675,"Oh, if they don’t have an iPod by now they really don’t want one.","Alright. Then we’re back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I’m for it.",Jim
19676,"So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you –","No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay Hey everybody!",Jim
19677,Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.,"No, no – this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.",Jim
19678,Do you have any pastries without fruit?,Yes! We do. Eclairs.,Jim
19679,"Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our –",– two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.,Jim
19680,"Oh, what did you do today?",I made a sale.,Jim
19681,"Oh, come on!",19. I had a really hard work out this morning.,Jim
19682,Excuse me.,Wow.,Jim
19683,A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.,"I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam’s at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.",Jim
19684,"Oh, baloney.",Good one.,Jim
19685,Ring her up.,"Absolutely, I will do that right now.",Jim
19686,"It’s been so long since I’ve been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley’s going to be there. Yes, oh my God!",I did not see this coming.,Jim
19687,"Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.",Okay.,Jim
19688,I want her to meet Michael.,Why?,Jim

19713,"What? What do you mean, suspend me?",I think you need to go a little easy. You can’t just suspend someone form work.,Jim
19714,I don’t think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.,"And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.",Jim

19730,What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?,What?,Jim

19734,"Oh. Well, I guess I’m just used to the restaurant business, where, if you’re in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.",Yeah.,Jim
19735,"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?",What’s that?,Jim
19736,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?,I don’t… I don’t think so.,Jim
19737,Why don’t you run them again?,What if she’s just flirting with you to get a better price?,Jim
19738,You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,’cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.,Jim
19739,I was after your money.,"Well, the joke was on you.",Jim
19740,"Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it’s not totally insane to try one more time.",It is totally insane.,Jim

19750,"You’re talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke’s on you ’cause I know Morse Code. Ha!","Yeah. That’s what we’re doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",Jim
19751,Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?,It’s a pen.,Jim
19752,"Well, that’s easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It’s stupid. I live in a fantasy world.",You do?,Jim
19753,"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can’t stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",But you didn’t believe any of this was true five minutes ago.,Jim
19754,Oh!…,"Oh, my God",Jim
19755,"It’s comfort food, all right? God.","You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just… stop beating yourself up.",Jim
19756,Because I have him investigating her. I’m waiting for a text update.,"Michael, no…",Jim
19757,"Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.","You should stop this, and you should call Dwight right now.",Jim
19758,"Uh, Franklin Mills.",What?,Jim
19759,"Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn’t Michael.","Wait, so are you… you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",Jim
19760,Did she see me?,Nice effort.,Jim
19761,No. No!,That’s… not okay.,Jim
19762,How about make-believe land has anything you want?,"Stanley, please, this is serious!",Jim

19764,"Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.",Exactly. It happened in Big.,Jim
19765,"No, I gotta go. Text me later.",I’m really too tired to do this.,Jim
19766,Me too!,Then let’s just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?,Jim
19767,"We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.",We can order in from Hooters.,Jim
19768,We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.,Billy Joel Rock Band.,Jim
19769,He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.,Now you’re just being hurtful.,Jim
19770,Guys?,Pam.,Jim
19771,You were supposed to be the Lookout.,"Yeah, well it’s really warm in here. It’s like a sleeping bag.",Jim
19772,"I don’t wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.",Sorry about that.,Jim
19773,"Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.","Well, you were surprisingly restrained.",Jim

19775,"I’m sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?","Right? So, uh, let’s uh…",Jim
19776,You love it. There ya go.,"Now, were those for the team?",Jim

19792,"Gabe, I told you all about the printers.","I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that’s the point.",Jim

20164,Don’t be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.,Do I have any say in this?!,Jim
20165,"Don’t what’s up us! You think you’re so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!","Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?",Jim

20168,"So you two are married to each other now, right?",Yeah.,Jim
20169,That’s sweet. How’s the sex?,...,Jim
20170,‘Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I’m cool. You’re the new guy. It’s cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.,That’s a lot of reasons!,Jim

20172,None of your business.,"Well, you know you can’t actually poison him.",Jim
20173,"It wasn’t poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.",I really think we should join forces on this one.,Jim
20174,Really.,"What do we think, what would drive him crazy.",Jim
20175,I know.,Here we go.,Jim
20176,"Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.","You’ve gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can’t get to them.",Jim
20177,Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn’t annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?,"Okay! Well this isn’t my best, but call Froggy101, say that we’re the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we’re giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it’s his own number.",Jim
20178,Who is Justice Beaver?,He… It’s a crime fighting beaver.,Jim

20182,"Well thanks, will do.","Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo’s a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you’re gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool.",Jim
20183,That sounds weird.,"It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo’s kept her eye on you!",Jim

20191,That’s a common swindlers trick.,"Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.",Jim
20192,So you wanna sell me magic beans.,Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield’s Miracle Legumes.,Jim
20193,"Jim, put those away.",I’m really sorry. Pam must have put those out.,Jim
20194,"just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?","They’re legumes Dwight, and you’re just gonna make fun of me, so why would I… You know what, this ends now.",Jim
20195,She’s the one.,She’s amazing. This is very exciting.,Jim
20196,"How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ‘ I lost my head when I fell in love with you.’",That’s a guarantee.,Jim
20197,"It’s easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.",Don’t think you need the corpse then.,Jim
20198,Where was that.,At a gas station.,Jim
20199,At a gas station?,Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.,Jim

20202,You were scared?,Yeah… it.s scary.,Jim

20217,"Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.","Wait, so, you don’t go into shock or die or anything?",Jim
20218,"No, it’s not insane, Oscar. I’m been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you’re gonna throw it all away? No.","Listen, you’re the one who decided to leave. Come on, he’s the new boss, you know we have to do this.",Jim

20239,That got a big laugh.,That did. Pretty huge laugh.,Jim
20240,In costumes!,And impressions!,Jim
20241,It’s his last Dundies.,You gotta play along man.,Jim
20242,I’m going to!,"Hey! It’s almost your last day, come sit with us.",Jim
20243,"Nah, I’m almost done.",You sure?,Jim
20244,I know…,Did you break the shredder Kevin?,Jim
20245,Jim where is Pam?,"Uhh, she’s still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.",Jim
20246,"Ummm… Hm… No. No. There’s a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he’s coming right in. Oh hi everybody, it’s Ping! And I’m here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You’ve been so wonderful! I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!","Hey, can I talk to you for a second?",Jim

20248,Ohh…,"What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?",Jim
20249,Okay…,You’re not leaving tomorrow. You’re leaving today right?,Jim
20250,Maybe.,"Wow, so that’s it huh? Just, four o’clock and you are gone for good.",Jim
20251,Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?,Absolutely not. It’s just that sometimes… goodbyes are a bitch.,Jim
20252,"T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. You started with this company, as a fine young man…",You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.,Jim

20258,Hey dudes!,Hey!,Jim
20259,"Oh my God, he hates me!",No he doesn’t. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.,Jim
20260,I know.,"Every time there’s a silence, your brain’s like “Heh-heh-huh-huh” .",Jim
20261,Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?,Careful. There is no inner circle.,Jim
20262,Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff?,"That’s Toys R Us, I think.",Jim
20263,"What’s wrong with juggling, Darryl? I’m a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.",Seriously?,Jim
20264,Look. I’m juggling eggs and bowling balls. I’m juggling with one hand. No hands.,What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?,Jim
20265,What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?,He’s good at his job. And I like working for him.,Jim
20266,Why don’t you talk to him about it?,"And say what? “Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?”",Jim
20267,Why don’t you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?,Mmm-hmm.,Jim
20268,So what’s up?,"Umm, really, it’s nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was —",Jim
20269,Yeah sure. Let’s make it a meeting.,"If it’s alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over —",Jim
20270,"What’s the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it’s the guys!","I know. Just the guys. Well, maybe that’s, uh, part of the problem. I think…so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads.",Jim
20271,Hot!,"Maybe there’s a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are…a little sexist, or —",Jim
20272,Damn!,Whoa. Whoa. Wait.,Jim
20273,Are you serious? Who feels this way?,Oh. Like nobody.,Jim
20274,"Umm, Pam?",It was —,Jim
20275,"Guys. Hold on. Doesn’t matter who, okay? I’m just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had – I had no idea.",That’s awesome.,Jim
20276,Absolutely.,"Hey, who’d you end up hiring?",Jim
20277,"Jim, you coming?","Oh yeah, did he text us?",Jim
20278,"Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us.",He didn’t text me.,Jim
20279,"Internally, for office use where do we get our paper from? Do we go –","Don’t worry, the first day’s always the hardest.",Jim
20280,Hey Jim.,Yeah.,Jim
20281,Can I help you?,Nope. Just… Okay.,Jim
20282,"So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?","Well, there is no inner…circle.",Jim
20283,You’re back in.,"You know what? Instead of a game, why don’t we do an exhibition? I’d love to see that dunk of yours.",Jim
20284,"Yeah, we’ll set that up one day.","Today. Now, maybe. ‘Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don’t have to mime it.",Jim
20285,"Yeah, I don’t know.",Why not?,Jim
20286,"Seems a little close, you sure that’s the real foul line?","15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?",Jim
20287,"Nah, that’s 15. Yeah.",Okay.,Jim
20288,"Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible.",Fantastic.,Jim
20289,Alright?,Yup.,Jim
20290,Tablab.,"Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?",Jim
20291,Who should I say is calling?,Erin.,Jim
20292,That’s true.,"All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?",Jim
20293,"Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?",Nope. Baskets have it.,Jim
20294,"Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. Jordan, gather my things from my desk.",Wait…,Jim
20295,Can’t stay there all day.,I’m coming.,Jim
20296,Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?,You’d slow me down.,Jim
20297,"General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.","Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?",Jim
20298,Define foment.,You define foment.,Jim
20299,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you’re doing? What’s this? What’s the Fist?","Oh, it’s just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It’s just a club. Guys talking, you know.",Jim
20300,You expect me to believe that you’re starting a rebellion?,"Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.",Jim
20301,"Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.","And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it’s a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.",Jim
20302,"Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha’s a rescue.",And the desk.,Jim
20303,"The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein’s desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I’m a very busy man. Let’s get right down to business.",Okay.,Jim
20304,Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you’ll be on your best behavior.,"I promise…d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so…",Jim
20305,Don’t make me fire you.,You can’t fire me. You’re acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.,Jim
20306,Don’t make me pre-fire you.,You wouldn’t dare.,Jim
20307,"Watch this. You’re pre-fired. And when I’m promoted, you’ll be full fired.","If you get promoted, and if you haven’t fallen in love with me by then.",Jim
20308,Okay.,"Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I’m on the spot. I don’t know. Um… you know what? I think I’m good.",Jim
20309,Thank God.,"Nope. When Jo’s here, can you work in “Shagadelic, baby,” at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?",Jim
20310,What’s jazz hands?,...,Jim
20311,Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert – the only man that ever turned me down.,"Well, I don’t know about that. Just wasn’t for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?",Jim
20312,Yep.,Yep.,Jim
20313,Shut up.,"Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There’s no debating that. But, I will say… in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.",Jim
20314,"Absolutely–I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.",Really?,Jim
20315,Yeah.,…What is it?,Jim
20316,"How would we know that, if you don’t…",You could just be saying it to get the job.,Jim
20317,"I guess I could be, if I was… who would do that?","How about this. Why don’t you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.",Jim
20318,Tell you what. I’ll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.,Okay.,Jim
20319,"Color-code sent documents, TM.",Did you just trademark that…,Jim
20320,Can you do any better on salary?,"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.",Jim
20321,"What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain’t cheap, you know.",Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.,Jim
20322,No.,"Can you… You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence… would be… in a dialogue with a subordinate?",Jim
20323,"Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.",Yes.,Jim
20324,"That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object… whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we’ve had already, you won’t be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?",Yes.,Jim
20325,"Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don’t see a bear drinking raccoon milk.",Oh.,Jim
20326,"Well, it’s one of my strengths, but it’s the manager’s job.","Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?",Jim
20327,Who’s that?,"So I think all we need is a resume, and we’ll be good right?",Jim
20328,I… I just thought you knew me.,"Yeah, it’s no big deal, just something that looks like that. Cool?",Jim
20329,"Well, I’d want to move further away, you know? Just… I don’t want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.",Can I ask why you’re leaving your current job?,Jim
20330,"I’m leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. You know, all of ’em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just… I had to get outta there.",Is this a bad time to be doing this?,Jim
20331,"Uh, 93 million miles.",Is it?,Jim
20332,"Well, I manage my department, and I’ve been doing that for several years now. And, god, I’ve learned a lot of life lessons along the way.","Your department’s just you, right?",Jim
20333,How’s the family?,Good!,Jim
20334,Good. They good?,Yeah.,Jim
20335,What’s your daughter’s name again? Peepee?,Peepa.,Jim
20336,"Peepa, how is she?",Great.,Jim
20337,"Great! Oh, that’s great… We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?",No.,Jim
20338,"Now, listen,…","You’re not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.",Jim
20339,"Okay, I know why you’re saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",Okay. That’s vivid.,Jim
20340,"I’m going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight’s Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam…",Yikes.,Jim
20341,Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.,"Well, you know how I like taking bribes.",Jim
20342,Ha ha!,"Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn’t trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?",Jim
20343,"Fine. I’ll do it without you, but you’ll regret this.",Okay.,Jim
20344,Let me get that for you.,Thank you.,Jim
20345,"So, uh… here you go.",Great.,Jim
20346,Hope it’s all right.,I’m sure it’s fine.,Jim
20347,"The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how’d he do?",Howard Cline?,Jim
20348,"Ehh, that’s not who I’m talking about.",Oh… Deshaun Williams.,Jim
20349,Yes. How did he do?,He’s an amazing man. He’s a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser…,Jim
20350,Come on man. I’m being serious. Don’t joke.,Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.,Jim
20351,Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.,"That’s very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?",Jim
20352,"By splitting the difference. Just… just, somewhere in the middle.",I think that’s probably all we need to hear from…,Jim
20353,"Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That’s what I’d do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There’d be no desks. You just sit on the floor.",That’s very…,Jim
20354,Is there a front runner?,You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.,Jim
20355,"Well, there must be someone who stands out.","No, not at all. In fact, I’m not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I’m just gonna pick a name out of the hat.",Jim
20356,My next boss will be my last boss. He’ll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously.,Uh–,Jim
20357,"You pick a crappy boss, you’re responsible for my crappy life.","Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.",Jim
20358,Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?,"No, was it good?",Jim
20359,I have no idea.,"Oh, I know this guy. Hello! Mr. “Soo-ven-yay.” Mr. “Jacques Soo-ven-yay.” Nice to meet you. It says here you’re French. So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.",Jim
20360,Assistant Regional Manager.,Assistant to the Regional Manager.,Jim
20361,Assistant Regional Manager.,What is it?,Jim
20362,Assistant Regional Manager.,"Oh, that’s my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn’t hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That’s a travesty.",Jim
20363,Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo… It’s me. I’m Dwight.,"No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you’re Dwight, and then… he’s the…",Jim
20364,Yeah.,Ohhhh!,Jim
20365,"Okay, it’s fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who’s got ya excited?",Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.,Jim
20366,It’s not. Let’s get Kelly in here to take his place.,Um… why Kelly?,Jim
20367,‘Cause Gabe’s tall and weak. She’s short and strong. I’m doing an opposites thing.,Okay.,Jim
20368,How’d my girl Nellie do?,"Oh, I didn’t know you knew her?",Jim
20369,She didn’t mention it?,No.,Jim
20370,Integrity move. I like it.,"You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn’t a good fit.",Jim
20371,Dwight Schrute.,"Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. We will let you know.",Jim
20372,You have to interview me…,I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.,Jim
20373,I demand more questions!,"All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let’s discuss.",Jim
20374,"Okay! If you’re not going to interview me, then I’ll do it.",Yes.,Jim
20375,"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and… getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That’s a great question. I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.","Thank you, Dwight.",Jim
20376,"Thank you. You’ll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you’re gonna like the call you’re going to receive. Oh, come on. I’m just happy that I got this meeting.","Well, that was quick.",Jim
20377,"Very, very interesting. And you know what? I’m impressed.",He’s not a real candidate.,Jim
20378,"I don’t know, Jim, ’cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.",You took the deal.,Jim
20379,"Yeah, it was a great deal.",That’s not okay.,Jim
20380,"Well, we could try him out for a little while… and if it doesn’t work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in…",What is happening right now?,Jim
20381,Is it true that you’re making Dwight the manager?,"No, why would you think that?",Jim
20382,"He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.","Okay. Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.",Jim
20383,"That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.","No, no, no. Not ever, ’cause that’s not gonna happen.",Jim
20384,"Well, it’s not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone’s getting a little power-mad.",Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I’m going a little bit crazy.,Jim
20385,Tuna… You’re completely sane.,Thank you.,Jim
20386,"Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?","Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?",Jim
20387,Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?,I suppose I am.,Jim
20388,Can I say…?,Yes.,Jim
20389,I think it should be Darryl.,Okay.,Jim
20390,I want an outsider.,Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-,Jim
20391,"I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.",Hey! Hey! Hey!,Jim
20392,It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?,"What? No, no, it’s not a vote.",Jim
20393,Then what was this all about?,I don’t know. This conversation really got away from me.,Jim
20394,I don’t care. They can just vote.,"No, they can’t. That’s not how this is gonna work. We’re going in this room, we’re going to have a meeting. We’re gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she’s gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? What the hell happened out there?",Jim
20395,Right here. Little Michael Scott-,"No, I told you I don’t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.",Jim
20396,"Because everything makes me cry, so what’s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.",He’s got a bank vault. That’s a start.,Jim
20397,Jim.,Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. Okay. What is this?,Jim
20398,What are you looking at?,"It’s, it’s nothing.",Jim
20399,"Yeah, it can’t be nothing.","It’s just a list of our names, split into two columns.",Jim
20400,What?,"Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?",Jim
20401,No.,"No. Okay. Um, I’ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?",Jim
20402,We need a warning signal.,"We don’t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-",Jim
20403,We do.,"I promise you, we don’t need a warning-",Jim
20404,"Okay, which side of the list am I on?",Left.,Jim
20405,Yes!,Why are you- How do you know?,Jim
20406,Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.,"Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert’s notebook.",Jim
20407,Maybe it’s a list of people he’s gonna fire.,"Okay, it’s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.",Jim
20408,"I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side’s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.",I don’t think it’s-,Jim
20409,Maybe we’re s’posed to do it with people in our group.,That’s not it.,Jim
20410,People in the other group.,"Mmum, still wrong.",Jim
20411,"No, it’s not. Here’s how we find out. Let’s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let’s just size each other up here and left side of the list… ATTACK!","Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!",Jim
20412,That’s great. Let’s do this guys.,"Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.",Jim
20413,I love you so much.,Hey. It’s nothing. Alright? I’ll text you when we get there. Let you know what’s going on.,Jim
20414,Okay.,Nope. No dog video.,Jim
20415,Okay.,Okay. See you guys.,Jim
20416,"Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?","Uhhh, the street?",Jim
20417,Sesame street.,"Oh, I didn’t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.",Jim
20418,"Elmo, god’s sake, it’s the Elmo era.",Right.,Jim
20419,Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn’t you agree.,"Yeah, she does like Elmo.",Jim
20420,"Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.",Shhh.,Jim
20421,"Man, it’s like hoisting a manatee. I can’t get a grip it’s so vast.",Ryan? A little help?,Jim
20422,"Jim, you alright? What are you doing?",Good. What? Nothin’,Jim
20423,Hey!,I don’t think we have to do this again cause it’s gonna take a whole.,Jim
20424,Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!,"Come on, man.",Jim
20425,Yes. Me do.,Alright.,Jim
20426,"Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.","Yeah, alright Kev why don’t you come with us?",Jim
20427,But save time. More success.,Does it save time though? ‘Cause we’ve been here for about an hour.,Jim
20428,"Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.","K, Kevin, are you saying “See the world”? or “Sea World?”",Jim
20429,See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.,"No, see? Right there, that’s the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don’t know if you’re saying “Sea World” or “see the world,” and it’s taking a lot of time to explain it.",Jim
20430,"I’m sorry,” L”?",How many L to a K?,Jim
20431,How on earth are we supposed to sell…?,I’ll take five.,Jim
20432,Justine. She said she’s coming by later.,Your ex-wife?,Jim
20433,"Nah man, we get along now. Real well.",Wow. Alright. Can’t wait to meet her.,Jim
20434,"What’s up, guys? Just thought we’d have a little rap session, talk about business…see how things are going? Ahem…",Why don’t you start?,Jim
20435,"If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You’re not making any sense.",He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?,Jim
20436,"You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? Tuna.","New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door…",Jim
20437,Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici’s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.,"She looks at it when she’s on the potty, and she makes the faces.",Jim
20438,Of course.,We know that.,Jim
20439,Great.,You have a walking buddy.,Jim
20440,That’s a tablecloth.,What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?,Jim
20441,That’s a crazy amount of points.,"But, what if?",Jim
20442,"Well, what do you want?","I don’t know, for such a crazy number I’d like something pretty crazy.",Jim
20443,"Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work.","That’s pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?",Jim
20444,Really?,"Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?",Jim
20445,"Swear to God, hope to die. Now let’s get to work!","Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case…let’s get to work.",Jim
20446,"Ask for Donald, Karen’s bananas.",Ok.,Jim
20447,T-bag bone…,Andrew.,Jim
20448,Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?,"No, I didn’t notice anything.",Jim
20449,You’ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!,"I don’t know what to tell you, man.",Jim
20450,You think it has something to do with that incentive program?,"Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.",Jim
20451,Bah…I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.,"Nah, you definitely weren’t kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.",Jim
20452,Hundred and twenty points.,"Yeah. Big sale. Don’t worry about it though, I don’t really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though… Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald…can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much.",Jim
20453,Yes!,"and I’m back. How are you sir?….I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?",Jim
20454,Yeah.,"Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this…",Jim
20455,Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ….Confession: I don’t know what I’m doing.,"I mean, do you like it? You having fun? Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun….and you did that.",Jim
20456,"My ass is only so big, I mean I can’t do this everyday.","But I think it’s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea….which, by the way, I can’t wait for.",Jim
20457,"No one expects me to go through with this, right?",Absolutely not.,Jim
20458,"It’s a Nard Dog! That’s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!",Pull up your pants.,Jim
20459,"You’re right, you’re right, you’re right. Uh! It’s so hard to find an occasion for this clip.","I’d hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70’s theme party, or a 70’s theme meeting, or a 70’s theme convention…",Jim
20460,Sure.,1870’s…,Jim
20461,I thought I was T-Dog.,"Nope, he means tuna dog.",Jim
20462,How’d it look?,"You’ve seen it, right?",Jim
20463,"Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.","Okay, don’t be gross.",Jim
20464,"It’s my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn’t really support another harmony part, so… Check it out, that’s my brother’s boss. Look how psyched he is, he’s having an awesome time.","Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?",Jim
20465,They don’t warn you when the cameras are driving by.,"Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?",Jim
20466,"I’m Walter, Andy’s younger brother.","Oh, hey, how are you doing, I’m Jim.",Jim
20467,"Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam .",No.,Jim
20468,Hell no. She wishes.,"No, no, no, no, no. No.",Jim
20469,What are they doing?,Closing ceremonies.,Jim
20470,Who cares.,Right here.,Jim
20471,MR. JAMES HALPERT!,"Keys, keys…",Jim
20472,Stop forgetting things.,"I didn’t forget them, they’re right here.",Jim
20473,MR. JAMES HALPERT!,"I’m so sorry, I think I forgot that thing…",Jim
20474,What? Idiot.,Whoo.,Jim
20475,MIS… MI… What are you doing?,"Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?",Jim
20476,"Put it on, man.",I don’t know if I can.,Jim
20477,Three Kings.,Alright.,Jim
20478,Hey!,"Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?",Jim
20479,What do you mean?,"Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?",Jim
20480,I saw a ghost.,"Mmhmm. No, but what I’m saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?",Jim
20481,"It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.","Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.",Jim
20482,Pam Halpert.,Hey it’s Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I’ve read a lot about this really great documentary.,Jim
20483,Is it called Ghostbusters?,It’s called Ghostbusters.,Jim
20484,It didn’t look like that.,It didn’t have a buster sign around him? Why don’t you draw him? Why don’t we see this whole thing.,Jim
20485,Ok fine I’ll draw him.,I ain’t fraid of no ghost. Whoa!,Jim
20486,What are we talking about?,I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.,Jim
20487,I’m using it. I’m about to play Starcraft with him .,Are you serious?,Jim
20488,Yeah I’m serious.,That’s funny. Ok.,Jim
20489,"I just don’t get it, Pam. I mean, you’re a rational person.",Thank you.,Jim
20490,Jim doesn’t let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?,"Careful, whoa. First of all, it’s not like I think that’s going to help the Eagles win.",Jim
20491,Really.,No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It’s not…,Jim
20492,Exactly.,Thank you.,Jim
20493,"I’m not gonna freak her out, Jim.",Ok.,Jim
20494,"I’m not gonna lie to her, either.","Oh, come on!",Jim
20495,"Oh, no.",Pink is the red-,Jim
20496,What are we talking about?,"I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.",Jim
20497,"Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there’s some sort of real phenomenon out there…","Oscar, how are you on that side?",Jim
20498,"No, Creed.",But that would make more sense.,Jim
20499,Closing time,…W R K.,Jim
20500,One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.,"Uh no it’s W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that’s what you are hearing.",Jim
20501,Nahh! No. Not Justine. Never Justine.,Is that off again?,Jim
20502,Oh yeah.,Ok.,Jim
20503,P.S. We should should kill him.,"Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?",Jim
20504,"No, it’s an accountability booster.",Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.,Jim
20505,"Well, I wouldn’t say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she’s hard at work.","Dwight, question.",Jim
20506,No questions.,If this doomsday device goes off…,Jim
20507,Accountability booster.,If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?,Jim
20508,"Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like…z64$8. Not that exactly Jim, something like that.",Ok.,Jim
20509,How about Scrantonstrangler666.,Nope.,Jim
20510,Wha…what’s Dwight’s mothers name.,Hmm…Heda. No.,Jim
20511,"Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.","Ok, where is he?",Jim
20512,"Uh, he’s at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.",I’ll try both.,Jim
20513,I’ll see you next week Will.,Robert.,Jim
20514,Jim what are you…What a surprise.,"Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.",Jim
20515,Yeah.,You up for a game?,Jim
20516,A game or a match?,Exactly. Here we go. Let’s do it.,Jim
20517,In the box.,In the box.,Jim
20518,Sounded like mine.,"Nah, I think it’s mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.",Jim
20519,"Well, it’s mine. You took it out of my bag.","Oh, oh yeah.",Jim
20520,Can I have it?,Yes. Right now? Yes.,Jim
20521,Yep.,Here you go.,Jim
20522,"ha, Jesus.","Awww, sorry. Did it break?",Jim
20523,"Nah, it’s good.",You sure?,Jim
20524,Yeah.,What kinda iPhone is that?,Jim
20525,It’s the standard one. The one everyone has.,Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?,Jim
20526,It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?,"Ha ha. No, I don’t. No, I don’t. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-",Jim
20527,Take it easy. Nice and easy.,"Ah! Classic, right?",Jim
20528,Oo!,I’m alright.,Jim
20529,You alright?,Yep.,Jim
20530,Skinned knee.,Yep. Ah. Oh.,Jim
20531,"Oo, a little ice on that maybe.",Yeah. That does not feel good.,Jim
20532,This could be real. Dwight’s pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.,"Ok, he didn’t fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.",Jim
20533,You couldn’t fix it.,I wasn’t here that day.,Jim
20534,Yes you were.,"No- Ok. Well, we’ll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?",Jim
20535,"I don’t think so, babe.","Ok, this is crazy.",Jim
20536,Eleven love. I win again.,Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?,Jim
20537,I don’t think so.,No? Come on.,Jim
20538,"Why? Not only are you terrible at squash, but you don’t even seem to enjoy it. Jim, this is not enough of a challenge for me.","Well, that is… because you didn’t realize that… I was left-handed.",Jim
20539,Hey – asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?,Hmm. Doubt it.,Jim
20540,You doubt it?,What’s that?,Jim
20541,Why do you doubt that she’s single?,Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we’d save her from Ryan right?,Jim
20542,Hey.,Hey.,Jim
20543,Helen Mirren. Hot?,Yeah. Super pretty.,Jim
20544,Huh. What about Cathy?,The temp?,Jim
20545,Yeah. Do you think she’s hot?,Nope.,Jim
20546,"I’m not asking if you’re in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?","And I’m telling you, I don’t.",Jim
20547,You don’t find Cathy attractive?,"No, I don’t.",Jim
20548,Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.,"Okay. Uh, I don’t. So are we good?",Jim
20549,"Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.","Oh, I stand corrected.",Jim
20550,I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?,"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.",Jim
20551,"Mike Tibbets, really?",Mm-hmm.,Jim
20552,"Hey, who’s this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?",Not his mom’s car.,Jim
20553,"Yeah, ’cause his mom’s car’s probably not a Nissan Z.",Touche?,Jim
20554,"Just going to walk over here- whoa, whoa, I’m slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to!",Dwight!,Jim
20555,"I’m fine, I’m totally fine.",Dwight! Dwight!,Jim
20556,Yes? Wha- Jim.,Sorry about that.,Jim
20557,"Aw, cramp, I’m just-",Dwight! Why?,Jim
20558,"I’m sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.",Leave.,Jim
20559,"Oh, that line from Zoolander?",Mm-hmm?,Jim
20560,It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.,Told you.,Jim
20561,Yeah?,You okay?,Jim
20562,Why won’t you just admit that she’s attractive? It’s kind of annoying that you won’t say it.,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?",Jim
20563,Come on.,Stop shoving me.,Jim
20564,"Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.",Really?,Jim
20565,"Why don’t you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? Now I’m going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?",Si.,Jim
20566,"Well, that’s what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.","Okay, Dwight, come on. You can go first.",Jim
20567,"Jim, are you serious?","Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.",Jim
20568,Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?,No.,Jim
20569,"Ah, see, was that so hard?",I am not lying.,Jim
20570,Really?,"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?",Jim
20571,Doesn’t your dad have high blood pressure?,"Yeah, but I don’t smoke.",Jim
20572,When was the last time you went to the doctor?,I don’t know.,Jim
20573,"Dwight, stop. I’m not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?","Okay, easy. Trust me, I’m around for the long-haul.",Jim
20574,"It’s not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.",Okay.,Jim
20575,"But… hey, Cece’s toothbrush.",Thank you.,Jim
20576,Oh! I’m going into labor! Oh my goodness!,"Oh okay, she’s going into labor. Make way, everybody!",Jim
20577,Never cry wolf.,Okay.,Jim
20578,Oh! Oh my goodness!,Oh my God!,Jim
20579,I’m really in labor! This is happening!,"Okay guys, here we go! We’ll see you!",Jim
20580,Oh!,How do you feel?,Jim
20581,And one for you.,Cool. Thanks.,Jim
20582,"Whoa, where you going?","Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?",Jim
20583,"Yeah, we’re not going to the visitor center. We’re not tourists.","No, of course we’re not tourists. We’re just people that aren’t from here who are taking a tour.",Jim
20584,Let’s talk about food for a second. Food for thought.,"Yeah, that’s what I had for breakfast and I think that’s probably why I’m still hungry.",Jim
20585,"Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn’t about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.",Only two hundred dollars?,Jim
20586,Spangler Springs is a mile this way.,Oh wow. So that’s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.,Jim
20587,Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders.,Yeah sorry everyone else didn’t come. I think they’re just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.,Jim
20588,Even without an audience you’re still at it.,What are you talking about?,Jim
20589,Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That’s what you did with this trip.,Andy – this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It’s just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you’re our regional manager. And guess what man? You don’t have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don’t believe me take a look at what’s on my head. I’m wearing a very pink hat. I’ve been getting weird looks all day because I’m pretty sure “DM does GB” means something kinda sexual. But guess who’s wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That’s huge.,Jim
20590,You don’t like the hats?,They’re terrible.,Jim
20591,"It’s kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.",Tuna?,Jim
20592,Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.,And to drink?,Jim
20593,Water.,"Oh-ho, I am in.",Jim
20594,"Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it’s not cool.",Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?,Jim
20595,"Open the door, Jim.",It’s locked.,Jim
20596,"It’s not locked, gimme that…","That’s weird, if it’s not locked, why isn’t it opening?",Jim

20619,Jim…,Yes?,Jim
20620,"Answer the question, please.","I don’t know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter.

I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue… this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she’s left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They’re calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?","I’m sorry, I thought you were making a joke.",Jim
20682,What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?,"I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.",Jim

20894,"Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.",Thank you.,Jim
20895,"But, there’s a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? They’re cheap. They’re unintuitive.

20945,"Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?","Oh, god, nature, please.",Jim
20946,"When two animals are having sex, one of them…",...,Jim

20949,"And there are no rules to that game. That wasn’t so perverted, now was it?","Was that it? No, that wasn’t bad.",Jim
20950,"My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn’t he decide who the manager is?",No. I would’ve said no.,Jim
20951,"Jim, time for your review.","No, it’s not, because you don’t really work here.",Jim
20952,"Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn’t you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?","Yeah, that’s the thing. I don’t know if you can even give raises.",Jim
20953,"Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?",Yes.,Jim

20966,"Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let’s not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.","Excuse me, one second. Hi.",Jim

20978,You read my mind.,Yeah. Whoa. Here’s one with his face whited out.,Jim
20979,Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he’s a hated Italian politician.,Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.,Jim

20982,That’s awful. What kind of restaurant.,Dwight!,Jim

20984,"Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don’t tell anyone about this.","No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or…",Jim
20985,"What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don’t have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.","No, that’s not what I-",Jim
20986,"Jim, could you give us a hand?","Absolutely. Yeah. Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It’s way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.",Jim
20987,"Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I’d be if Pam died.","Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit… enough. A good amount. Not the most, though.

20988,So we’ve established-,No. No.,Jim
20989,"Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you’re my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?","Oh, I’ll do it. I will volunteer.",Jim

21011,"Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I’m the first to know.","Wow That’s terrible, I really liked him.",Jim
21012,Oh you liked him? That’s nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times?

21013,"Okay well, that’s a relief!",Wow! Look at that! It says he’s actually playing State College. That’s only three hours away!,Jim

21018,"What haven’t I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I’m writing, though it feels more like I’m receiving it than writing it.","Wow, that’s exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.",Jim
21019,I know!,"Wait, what? Come on!",Jim
21020,"We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.","Okay, Oscar, I’m not saying you’re not dreamy, because you are, but isn’t it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?",Jim

21261,He’s gonna be disappointed.,Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.,Jim
21262,Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled!,What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!,Jim
21263,"For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich. Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company’s stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson .",Good afternoon!,Jim
21264,Please sir! Spare him. Please.,"Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin’ at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!",Jim
21265,And you didn’t call Jim – that seems significant.,"Hi, David.",Jim
21266,"No, he shouldn’t.","Go ahead David, I’m listening.",Jim
21267,Can you go instead?,I can’t. I have the thing.,Jim
21268,Okay lets get started.,"Yeah, I’m here. Are we all on?",Jim

21272,"Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert.","Oh, Sorry, I uh… was just saying that we should uh…",Jim
21273,"Whoa. I think there’s been a bit of a mistake. We’re trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman.","Um, you know what? I.. should have just had… I should have just had you call me on my cell.",Jim
21274,"Uh, yeah…",I’m gonna try a different spot. Okay?,Jim
21275,"Okay, yeah.","Okay, I’ll call you right back.",Jim

21283,"Yeah, well, it’s not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don’t know how we’re gonna do this.","Uh, what does — what does that mean?",Jim
21284,"Sure you don’t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.","You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?",Jim
21285,Are you avoiding your phone call?,"What? Yeah, right. As if.",Jim
21286,"Last week Jim wasn’t there, and they named the company Athlead.",I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.,Jim
21287,Tell them your opening line.,"Hey David, how would you like a guy who’s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?",Jim
21288,I think it’s good. He likes fishing.,This is gonna be awful.,Jim

21296,"You know what? I don’t know where the years went.  ‘Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don’t even recognize them.",Tell me about it.,Jim
21297,Whose hands are these? Theyre not my hands. I don’t know.,All right. You know what?  Maybe we’ll just… We’ll go slow.,Jim
21298,Don’t be pushy Jim. It’s tacky.,"All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that’s– that’s decorative.",Jim
21299,"No, there’s wine in here.",Still decorative.,Jim

21307,I’m sure it’s fine. it’s a blue shirt.,"Well, yeah, but I’m wondering if it’s too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?",Jim
21308,"Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don’t care about Jim’s new sports job in Phila-Whatever.","So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don’t know the end of the word “Philadelphia”?",Jim
21309,"What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas’ rural German companion, Belsnickel.","Yes! That, that, that! We’re definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?",Jim
21310,No!,"Done, right?",Jim
21311,I’m on it.,Right.,Jim
21312,"Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.",Whoo!,Jim

21319,"Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! Ohh…Too much strudel.","So he’s kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.",Jim
21320,"No, much better–No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.",Wow! It’s my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.,Jim
21321,"No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They’re a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.","Oh, it’s like naughty or nice.",Jim
21322,"No, impish or admirable.","Quick question–Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?",Jim
21323,I decided earlier.,"Oh, nice. Did you check that list?",Jim
21324,Of course I checked it.,But more than once? ’cause you could have made a mistake.,Jim
21325,I checked it more than once.,"Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you’re gonna find out who’s–",Jim

21344,Okay.,All right.,Jim
21345,Love you.,Love you.,Jim
21346,"No, thanks. I’ll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.","Yep, I did say that.",Jim
21347,Jim!,What’s going on? Where’s the belsnickel?,Jim

21357,"To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.",I think they’re going to the conference finals.,Jim
21358,No.,"Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don’t even-…",Jim
21359,The Hawks are terrible. They’re always terrible.,"Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the…",Jim
21360,Great. Everything’s great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?,"Uhh, a little bit. It’s a lot of pressure, you know, but that’s what I signed up for right?",Jim
21361,"Jim, limo’s here.","Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.",Jim
21362,"Oh, call me later!",Ok,Jim
21363,Good luck!,Thanks!,Jim
21364,Love you.,Love you too. Bye.,Jim
21365,"Yeah, take some home if you want.","Oh no, no, no. That’s ok. Um I’m sorry, is this the conference center?",Jim
21366,"No, Mr. Irving called. Said he’d rather meet you at his private court.",You gotta be kidding me.,Jim
21367,I hope you don’t mind me bringing you out here. I can’t get my knees under a desk.,Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.,Jim
21368,"Well, do you think you can sink one from deep?","Listen, I don’t mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.",Jim
21369,"Okay. Wow, Halpert’s got game.","Alright. Oh, sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s my wife, can I take this?",Jim
21370,It’s your wife? You better take it.,"Right! Hey, what’s up? Everything ok?",Jim
21371,"Oh, no everything’s great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.","It’s still happening right now actually, so uh…",Jim
21372,"He’s really making you work for it, huh?","Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything’s okay?",Jim
21373,"Great. I am killing it over here. Jim, I gotta go.","Okay, bye. So sorry about that.",Jim
21374,"No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think?",I love it.,Jim
21375,"You’re Kareem, coming to help.","Okay, I’m Kareem. That makes total sense. I’m Kareem. You’re Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.",Jim
21376,And it went like this.,And that’s all?,Jim
21377,That’s it.,"No one will believe this back home, but that’s okay. Let me show you how it’s done.",Jim
21378,"I hope you’ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it’s time for another episode of “Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire”.","Sorry, Stinky, can’t do it. Too busy.",Jim
21379,"Oh, god, this again? You’re Stinky.","Okay. There’s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.",Jim
21380,"Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. See what you leave me with here, Jim?","Hey, I’m in Philadelphia right now.",Jim
21381,How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.,Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?,Jim
21382,…And I want to reach every demographic possible.,"No, I hear what you’re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?",Jim
21383,"We’re talking weeks here, not months, right?","Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.",Jim
21384,Alright. Good.,"Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. Hey! How are you?",Jim
21385,Good!,What are you doing here?,Jim
21386,I just wanted to see you!,That’s so great!,Jim
21387,"Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!","It’s pretty great, right? I mean, we’re coming along… Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis’s timeline",Jim
21388,Okay,"Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.",Jim
21389,"Wow, this place is… so great. I had no idea – on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.","Well, I mean, I don’t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so… These things go down all the time.",Jim
21390,"If this company’s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.",Are you cool to just hang out?,Jim
21391,"Sure, no problem.",Yeah? You ready?,Jim
21392,Yeah.,Let’s do it!,Jim
21393,“Mandate”- Always think of two men on a date. I have gay friends… I have one gay friend. Oscar?,Mm-hm,Jim
21394,I’m a laywer. I’m the only one here who can honestly help.,"And as you know, I was a paper salesman. Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked.",Jim
21395,Not us.,"Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They’re going to make you pay for the fish, and… they wanted to know when you can start.",Jim
21396,Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.,"You could’ve just called that an alliance too, right?",Jim
21397,When are you talking to David Wallace?,"I’m talking to him this afternoon, but don’t get your hopes up.",Jim
21398,And this chair’s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!,I’m on the phone. I’m on the phone.,Jim
21399,No doy!,I’m just gonna call you back. Thanks.,Jim
21400,No earbuds!,I’m sure he’s just nervous.,Jim
21401,"Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?","Sure, yeah, go ahead.",Jim
21402,"Thanks, dude. You—you sure it’s okay? ‘Cause you’re kinda—","Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You’re clean, right?",Jim
21403,"Oh, Dove Men.","Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don’t listen to it at all because we’re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so—",Jim
21404,"Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?","Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.",Jim
21405,"Thanks, dude.",Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.,Jim
21406,Why?,I need you to breathe in my face right now.,Jim
21407,...,"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?",Jim
21408,Wintergreen.,"I knew it, I knew it.",Jim
21409,"Yeah, good nose.","I looked at you coming around, and I said, “Wintergreen.”",Jim
21410,"Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.",How is it my fault?,Jim
21411,"Here’s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.",But it’s Dwight who’s bring in all the weirdos.,Jim
21412,"Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.","Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input—",Jim
21413,"Really? That’s interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who’s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.","I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife—",Jim
21414,"Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.",Oh. Um…,Jim
21415,Yeah.,Okay. I can’t say that that’s not fair.,Jim
21416,And I know we have a call scheduled for later –,"Oh, yeah, so we’ll just do that later.",Jim
21417,Yeah. What’s up Jim?,"Uh… Well, it’s about Athlead. I’m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?",Jim
21418,"It’s okay. Go ahead, Jim.",There’s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor –,Jim
21419,"Okay. Jim, I’m gonna have to stop you right there.","Yes, okay. Bye.",Jim
21420,I’d love to invest.,"No, thanks.",Jim
21421,"Psst. Jim Jim? Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.","Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I’m not looking south, I’m not livin’. That’s what I always say.",Jim
21422,And I was thinking it’s only fair that you help make this decision since they’ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.,But you know I wouldn’t hire any of these all-stars.,Jim
21423,"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it’s your call.",Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?,Jim
21424,I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn’t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.,I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.,Jim
21425,Yes. Thank you. Amazed.,"And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.",Jim
21426,What? This is such bullcrap!,"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.",Jim
21427,Wow. So much crap. It’s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?,Too much now.,Jim
21428,"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert’s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.",That seems inconsiderate.,Jim
21429,"Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right?",All right. I think that went well.,Jim
21430,"Oh, cool. Hey Clark.","Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.",Jim
21431,"Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.",Okay. I’m really sorry I told the guys I’d be there for the board meeting.,Jim
21432,Of course.,I’ll call you when I get there.,Jim
21433,Okay.,All right.,Jim
21434,Bye.,Take care of my wife. I will be back.,Jim
21435,"Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.","And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it’s, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.",Jim
21436,Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.,I’m couching it!,Jim
21437,Which usually means there’s clothes all over the living room.,"And this dude labels his food. He’s the clean one. And, I’m the messy one. How much fun is this?",Jim
21438,Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.,Who is this guy? We are killing it.,Jim
21439,Yes sir.,Yeah!,Jim
21440,This is the team.,"Nice job, man.",Jim
21441,You too… Darryl.,"What? Oh, man! I’m sorry about that.",Jim
21442,It’s cool. Reading’s tricky sometimes.,"Oh, um… Are you really mad about this?",Jim
21443,That’s my go-to thermos. That’s all.,"Oh. It’s your go-to therm. Oh, man. That’s a bummer. I’m sorry about that.",Jim
21444,No big deal. No big deal.,"No, no. If it’s a big deal, it’s a big deal.",Jim
21445,"Nah, nah…",No big deal.,Jim
21446,"Nah, nah, nah. You don’t have to do that.","Honestly, I don’t mind. Did you want me to wash it for you or…",Jim
21447,I don’t know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?,OK. Here ya go.,Jim
21448,"Oh, hey.",Hey.,Jim
21449,I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It’s cool?,Yeah. Totally.,Jim
21450,All right.,It’s mine. Don’t worry.,Jim
21451,I didn’t say anything.,I don’t think you had to.,Jim
21452,Excuse me?,"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn’t use that?",Jim
21453,"What you need flour for, Jim?",That’s not the point.,Jim
21454,What? You making bread?,"No, I’m not making bread.",Jim
21455,What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?,"Darryl, it doesn’t matter. I think you know the point I’m trying to make.",Jim
21456,"All right, I’m being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just… you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That’s all.",It’s all good. Are we all good?,Jim
21457,We good.,What’s that cooler?,Jim
21458,Nothing. It’s mine. What happened to my Tavis Smileys?,"Oh, crap. Were those yours?",Jim
21459,Oh. Come on!,Oh. Oh!,Jim
21460,Damn!,You win. How good did that feel?,Jim
21461,Hey. I feel so lucky we’re in the same city for Valentine’s Day.,"It’s like magic. Or, it’s like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.",Jim
21462,Alakazam!,"By the way, they do need an extra day next week.",Jim
21463,These are gross.,They are terrible.,Jim
21464,"Oh, hey, don’t fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.",Oh my god. That’s so romantic.,Jim
21465,It’s with Brian and Alyssa.,Oh my god. That’s less romantic.,Jim
21466,"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.","Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That’s good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?",Jim
21467,"Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.",What?,Jim
21468,He’s on a no carb thing. Supposedly.,Oh.,Jim
21469,Yeah.,"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I’ve wanted the opportunity to say thanks for… everything. And I’m really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.",Jim
21470,"We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.","Well, I mean, that’s OK. It doesn’t mean that it’s over. Right? I mean, couples fight.",Jim
21471,Yeah.,What?,Jim
21472,At least my crying won’t get you fired.,Crying?,Jim
21473,"OK, I can tell you’re mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don’t know, tell me why?","I don’t know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don’t know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.",Jim
21474,I didn’t tell you about the crying because I didn’t want you to know how upset I was. Because it would’ve stressed you out and you’re always saying how much you don’t want more stress.,"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.",Jim
21475,It’s not Brian’s fault.,"No, you’re right. And, and I’m not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don’t have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn’t there. So, let’s just forget about it.",Jim
21476,Oh?,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I’m sure you have stuff to do. So we can just… I don’t know, drop me at the bus station?",Jim

21528,"I actually wrote a screenplay, it’s called “The Big Piece”","Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it’s autobiographical.",Jim
21529,"Half biopic and half superhero movie. A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard-",OK,Jim

21548,...,Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple’s counseling.,Jim
21549,"Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren’t in couple’s counseling, are you? Oh, God.","No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we’re just starting couple’s counseling. Uh, which doesn’t sound any better.",Jim

21551,You’re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.,Mm-hmm.,Jim
21552,"Well, what’s a little while?",What do you mean?,Jim
21553,"I mean, what’s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn’t know when it’s gonna end.",That’s kind of an impossible question.,Jim
21554,"So, we had couple’s therapy.",No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.,Jim
21555,And we have homework.,"Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other’s sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam’s been doing to run the house while I’m in Philly.",Jim
21556,And we’re also supposed to speak our truths.,Mmhm.,Jim
21557,"Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn’t have had this opportunity for couple’s therapy.","Oh, we’re supposed to call everything we don’t want to do “opportunities.”",Jim
21558,"Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.","Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn’t out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.",Jim
21559,"Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.","Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.",Jim

21561,"Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-","Hey that’s work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.",Jim
21562,"Uh, to speak my truth, I’d appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. I appreciate the sacrifice.","Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that’s a little unfair.",Jim
21563,"Really? I’ve been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That’s really your truth?",I guess I will swallow my truth.,Jim

21574,"Tell me about it, you know? I’ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don’t know if I’m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.","Huh. Well, you know, you can’t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what’s most important. That’s my new thing.",Jim
21575,"Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and—",Smasher!,Jim
21576,"I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.",Fireball!,Jim
21577,Ah! That’s how it’s done.,That’s pretty good. I feel safe.,Jim
21578,"Right. Yeah. But, you know, I’ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I’ve earned this. I mean, you know?",You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I’m here.,Jim

21584,"So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.",Again.,Jim
21585,"Again! And I’m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?",Not at all. It should be Dwight.,Jim
21586,You sure?,"You’re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh—",Jim
21587,Yeah.,"Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don’t want to meet that person.",Jim
21588,Yes. Yeah.,"I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.",Jim
21589,"Oh, boy. Um—","If you could help me out, that would be—",Jim

22580,Yes.,"What do we know about this bird? You might think, “Not much. It’s just a bird.” But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it’s that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.",Pam
22581,"Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny.","And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don’t think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",Pam
22582,Shhh.,"An impression, then. Lastly, we can’t help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn’t mean he was alone. Because I’m sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten.",Pam

22623,Ok.,"And, I’m freaking out.",Pam
22624,Yeah.,That movie is so scary!,Pam
22625,I know!,But I’m holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.,Pam
22626,No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?,Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don’t put the pictures on the box.,Pam
22627,"No, you’re making this up!",Would I make that up?,Pam
22628,"Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.","Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.",Pam

22957,"I— I— Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin’ fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that…",It’s really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.,Pam
22958,"Yeah… you are… ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don’t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.

22984,"Mm… not really, no.",It’s disgusting and demeaning.,Pam
22985,"Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot.

The thing that I’m just trying to say to you, Jim… and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle.

23026,Because he wasn’t following the rules.,I think they were just having fun.,Pam
23027,"But they didn’t complete their task, Pam! If people can’t carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?",It tells me nothing.,Pam

23406,"Yeah, the booth is lame without it.",I only brought the one.,Pam
23407,Are you mental?,"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference.

23416,"This is Darryl Philbin. Isn’t he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will “do” you. No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?",Excuse me.,Pam

23421,"Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It’s really basic. We’re looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess.",I can do that.,Pam

23547,It was Pam’s idea. Pam was the mastermind.,… Got you.,Pam
23548,"Well, I’ll be the judge of that. What do you got?","Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock.

23549,That is good.,Thank you.,Pam
23550,"Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. Oh, text message from my brother. “Pam cool. Welcome to the family.”",Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?,Pam
23551,"Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn’t know it from looking at her, but Pam’s a gold-digger.","Hey, New York ain’t free. Get back to work.",Pam

23559,"I need a decent bonus, because I’m actually in the process of buying my parents’ house so that they can retire.

I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.",Maybe it’s because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.,Pam
23560,Is there some evidence?,"Ooh, cute shoes online.",Pam
23561,"Dwight, get out of my nook!",That’s what she said! That’s what she said! That’s what she said!,Pam

23572,I’m gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton.,Wow.,Pam
23573,Why did you come to New York in the first place?,"Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.",Pam
23574,"Right. And that’s why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you — really you just got here, you know? You can’t do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has — all the opportunity is here. All the — the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it.",Jim’s in Scranton.,Pam
23575,"I know. But all I’m saying is, if there’s even a teeny, tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here, because you don’t want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway … I will see you tomorrow.",I’ll see you tomorrow.,Pam
23576,I’m pretty much devastated.,Ask if there’s anything you can do.,Pam

23583,"It’s not— It’s not about me. I mean, this your dream.",I know.,Pam
23584,And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?,Right.,Pam

23600,"I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.","I know, can you believe it?",Pam
23601,"Yeah, it’s crazy. But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone’s gonna have to just get there and clean it up.","I guess that’s why we have a temp, huh?",Pam
23602,"Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me. I would just make it worse.",How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?,Pam
23603,I— I would find a way.,"You’ve seen things cleaned before though, right?",Pam

Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do… which was just to wait. Uh, don’t get me wrong.

24218,Let’s get back to the matter at hand.,"Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody’s mom…",Pam
24219,"I don’t like the tone here… this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.","Uhh, huh, ho… oooh my God, you are ridiculous!",Pam

24231,"Well, that is not gonna happen!",Then why’d you even offer!?,Pam
24232,Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.,"Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!",Pam
24233,You know what? I’m gonna start dating her even harder.,What’s that supposed to mean?,Pam

24357,"Oh, well I yell. You’ve heard me yell.","Oh. Ok. I’ve heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, ‘Hey, look. We parked over here!’.",Pam
24358,"Well, that was apple-picking day and there’s no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.","Well, you’ll figure it out.",Pam

24368,"Guys, I’m starting to think Pam’s not really even pregnant.","Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn’t Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we’ll move on.",Pam
24369,"Excellent idea, Pam.",Thank you.,Pam
24370,There must be some reasonable explanation for this.,"No, wait, come on. I didn’t miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.",Pam

24404,What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?,That’s the weirdest possible solution to the problem.,Pam
24405,"Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it.",Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?,Pam
24406,No.,"Maybe, because it doesn’t seem to be going super well.",Pam
24407,"Well, you didn’t consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well?",Nope. ‘Cause we’re really nice people but you don’t seem to like us.,Pam

24413,"Oh, getting there, huh?","No, no. I still have time.",Pam
24414,"Yeah, we’re slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.","If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.",Pam
24415,"Not to mention the extra night’s sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it’s crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it’s a boy.",I cannot wait for that joke to be over.,Pam
24416,"Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.","You know the baby’s not going to live here, right?",Pam
24417,"Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don’t want to know. Tell me later. Let’s go! Let’s go! Hospital!","Okay, okay, we’re not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.",Pam

24421,"I… Pam, please.","I’m going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.",Pam

24425,"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that’s a big deal. While we’re on the subject, why don’t I just run you down to the hospital and we’ll just do a quick check?",Not until midnight.,Pam
24426,"Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body’s signals.","Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don’t think I’m going to make it until midnight if I’m just sitting here thinking about it.",Pam
24427,"Oh! Oh, alright. That’s a good one.","Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.",Pam
24428,"Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.","Oh, thanks, Kelly.",Pam

24434,"No, I don’t.",Okay.,Pam
24435,Hey.,"Hey. I’m not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you’ll try to drive me to the hospital.",Pam
24436,"Ah, you know me too well.","Okay, Jim.",Pam
24437,Yeah? … Oh.,"Everything is fine. You don’t have to worry. Try not to think about it. She’s not coming out for a while, okay?",Pam

24439,Mad? How could I be mad? We’re having a little girl.,Mm-hmm.,Pam

24441,"Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.",Good.,Pam
24442,Yeah.,Okay.,Pam
24443,"Alright… Hey, did you change?","Oh, yeah, my water broke.",Pam
24444,"4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn’t have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let’s go to the hospital, shall we?","No, not yet, Michael.",Pam
24445,We can do…,"Oh, wow, it’s almost time for ultra feast! Where’s Kevin?",Pam
24446,"Our ultra feast menu’s theme: Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.

24448,"Hey, come on. Let’s go to the hospital.","They’re not that bad still, babe.",Pam
24449,"Pam, Pam, it’s time. Let’s go to the hospital.","No, it’s passing, it’s fine. It’s okay.",Pam

24573,"Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure…",Thanks Toby.,Pam
24574,"Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I’m glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what’s really important. It’s not about showing you’re in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It’s about forgiveness. And yes, I’m talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.",I don’t think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.,Pam
24575,"Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",Yeah. “I vant to count to ten”.,Pam
24576,Why didn’t you do Oscar the Grouch?,That would have been funny.,Pam
24577,"All right, so I’ll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.","You know, maybe there’s an opportunity for a joke there, like, um… like, “I just delivered a baby. They didn’t offer me a guarantee.”",Pam
24578,Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.,"We have good give and take. I give, he takes.",Pam
24579,I don’t even know who you are anymore.,Yee.,Pam
24580,You look exactly alike.,"Oh, no we’re actually married. We’re not brother and sister.",Pam
24581,No.,I’ll have one.,Pam
24582,"Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.","Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn’t still be here.",Pam
24583,"Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.",What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?,Pam
24584,What was that?,Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.,Pam
24585,"Pam, you know he’s not gonna get anywhere, and he’s gonna blow our sale.",Who cares? It’s not that huge a sale.,Pam
24586,"Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.","Don’t act like you understood anything that guy said. Good luck, wingman.",Pam
24587,She just crossed her arms together… that’s bad.,Maybe she’s just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.,Pam
24588,She does not like him.,You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,Pam
24589,’cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.,I was after your money.,Pam
24590,"Well, the joke was on you.","Yes, it was.",Pam
24591,Pam?,Hmm?,Pam
24592,What do you think?,"Um… I think it’s really, really unlikely.",Pam
24593,Okay.,Really unlikely. But I can’t say that it’s impossible.,Pam
24594,I don’t know. I don’t know. Can’t really trust my feelings anymore.,"You know what, Michael? For what it’s worth… I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.",Pam
24595,She suckered you too.,Mm-hmm.,Pam
24596,Was it the cleavage?,"Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.",Pam
24597,"It’s not a signal. It’s just a coincidence. No, it’s not even a coincidence. It’s just something that happened.",Michael…,Pam
24598,Well…,She doesn’t want you to return the barrette. She’s not interested in you.,Pam
24599,"Yeah, I know. I know.",I’m sorry.,Pam
24600,I know. You’re right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.,Michael!,Pam
24601,Yup. That’s exactly what we did.,"It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, “I will when you lose the baby weight.”",Pam
24602,"Okay, you get out of here, big dog. Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.",Stanley got to go.,Pam
24603,You guys think Donna’s cheating on me?,"No, Michael, no.",Pam
24604,Are you nuts?,You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place…,Pam
24605,"… and… we had sex, too.",That is right. Don’t make any more of it.,Pam
24606,How?,How what?,Pam
24607,How do I not make any more of it?,You could start by concluding this meeting.,Pam
24608,"No, no…","Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",Pam
24609,Run what?,"Amok. It means, don’t let your imagination run out of control.",Pam
24610,"Why didn’t you just say that, Pam?","Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.",Pam
24611,"It’s never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn’t have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",Oh!…,Pam
24612,"I know. Well, I hope you’re right. We’ll see what Dwight says.",Why do we have to see what Dwight says?,Pam
24613,"Michael, no…","No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",Pam
24614,It’s too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.,"Michael. Okay, I’m… I’m going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",Pam
24615,"God, this is so disgusting.",Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.,Pam
24616,I know.,And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you’re in.,Pam
24617,"That’s not true. You’re right, I ruin everything. And I’ve known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",Helene.,Pam
24618,Helene?,My mother.,Pam
24619,Oh.,"My mother, Helene.",Pam
24620,What?,Hmm? Oh. It’s probably nothing.,Pam
24621,"Wait, so are you… you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.,Pam
24622,Wow. That’s exciting.,"Hey, Michael.",Pam
24623,Hey.,"I’m sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.",Pam
24624,Well it can wait. It can wait.,I lied it’s personal. It’s about me and Jim. We’re… I just… you’re the only person I can talk to.,Pam
24625,Oh.,And…,Pam
24626,"And they are having problems, so sh…","No, not… we’re not… we’re not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love…",Pam
24627,Good in bed.,"Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.",Pam
24628,"Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?",I need you to sign this! So bad!,Pam
24629,"Okay, weirdo.",I love … this idea is neat. I’ve never been. It sounds lovely.,Pam
24630,Yeah I think it’ll be a nice trip. We’re gonna get a lot done.,"You’re gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at… golfing. Are you a golfer?",Pam
24631,"Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",Absolutely.,Pam
24632,Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?,I don’t know who he is.,Pam
24633,God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?,What?,Pam
24634,"I’m gonna kill him. No, I’m not. I feel… I… no, I’m not going to kill him.",You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.,Pam
24635,I have to hear it from her.,You have to settle down first.,Pam
24636,I need to have her tell me herself. Right?,Okay. Okay. Yes.,Pam
24637,I need to have her say…,"Yeah, but you have to calm…",Pam
24638,"I need to say, “What the hell is that? What the hell is that?”","Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.",Pam
24639,"No, God! No, no, oh, my God!","Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",Pam
24640,Pam told me.,Did she see me?,Pam
24641,It’s so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.,Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?,Pam
24642,Do you want me to go back to the store?,"No, no, no, it’s fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open ’em up.",Pam
24643,This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.,"Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we’re just trying to get out in front of this.",Pam
24644,"After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That’s what Pam told me.","Yeah, or no… well… I don’t know. I’m sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I’d be running this.",Pam
24645,We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.,"And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.",Pam
24646,He’s coming.,"Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get’s like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don’t know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.",Pam
24647,Hey everyone.,"No, out! Get out now! Leave now.",Pam
24648,"Leave, get outta here.",Leave!,Pam
24649,Right now!,"Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?",Pam
24650,That’s hilarious.,That’s awesome. You want some ice cream?,Pam
24651,No secret crying. Hasn’t even opened the tissue box in there.,Could he still be seeing her?,Pam
24652,I’m really too tired to do this.,Me too!,Pam
24653,Then let’s just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?,Hey Michael.,Pam
24654,Hey.,"We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.",Pam
24655,"Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.",We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.,Pam
24656,That… exists?,Yes.,Pam
24657,"Okay, well, I’ll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.","Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?",Pam
24658,Pam.,"Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.",Pam
24659,Can you two please join me in my office? Now.,You were supposed to be the Lookout.,Pam
24660,Sorry about that.,So embarrassing.,Pam
24661,"Well, you were surprisingly restrained.",We will be well-rested tomorrow.,Pam
24662,Ah.,I don’t think those were yours to take.,Pam
24663,"I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.",Did you talk to him?,Pam
24664,I did.,You talked to the man whose wife you’re having an affair with.,Pam
24665,What about an energy drink or something?,"It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.",Pam
24666,"Well, it doesn’t mean I can’t drink it.","Well, it does and it doesn’t.",Pam
24667,A restful location. Talk to Glen. He’ll take you up in the lift.,You sleep in the warehouse?,Pam
24668,Pam.,Okay.,Pam
24669,What was you? You were the leak?,Okay. I’m talking to this woman at daycare…,Pam
24670,Uh-huh.,"She’s telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!",Pam
24671,Why’d you do that?,Her husband’s a reporter.,Pam
24672,Yeah.,"So now everyone hates Andy, and it’s this whole mess, and I don’t know what to do.",Pam
24673,"Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.",I could tell Jo… or I could tell Michael.,Pam
24674,You leaked it?,"I don’t know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or – I don’t want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!",Pam
24675,"I don’t know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god… my mind is going a mile an hour.",That fast?,Pam
24676,So see you in Meredith’s van in five minutes.,"Yeah, you didn’t need to actually say it.",Pam
24677,What do we got?,Um…,Pam
24678,"Hey guys, sorry I’m late.",We’re not going for yogurt.,Pam
24679,"Okay, here’s what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.",Wouldn’t we get fired for smashing all the computers?,Pam
24680,That idea sucks.,I don’t think that’s a good idea.,Pam
24681,"That’s just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let’s just…","Nobody’s going to prison, okay? Um… all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we’ll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.",Pam
24682,"I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that’s the point.","Yes, it’s totally obvious.",Pam
24683,"Hey, what’s so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.",Sorry.,Pam
24684,"Oh, no. Don’t worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but…",It was really funny.,Pam
24685,"Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.",I love you.,Pam
24686,Don’t bother Luke.,Why is there a circle with a line through it?,Pam
24687,"Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?",Or enough for everyone?,Pam
24688,You really think you can make it up to me with food?,I don’t know. That usually works.,Pam
24689,"Oh, yeah. This’ll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.","Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses “Doors closed” the doors open. Or he presses “lobby” it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?",Pam
24690,Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.,Dwight is about to get so Pammed.,Pam
24691,"Hey, did you SMS text message me?","Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.",Pam
24692,"Okay, that’s weird. Just hitting “door closed.” What?",There we go.,Pam
24693,"Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.",Let’s just calm down.,Pam
24694,"Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.",I don’t-,Pam
24695,Use your talons! Pry ’em open!,"Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!",Pam
24696,"Well, don’t look, freak!","Dwight, what are you doing!? We’ve only been in here for, like, two seconds!",Pam
24697,I’ve got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!,You’ve gotta be kidding me.,Pam
24698,Pam?,"Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.",Pam
24699,I did not do this.,"I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.",Pam
24700,This is impressive.,"Well, you know… they don’t call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.",Pam
24701,Do they call you that?,They do call me that.,Pam
24702,"Come on, give me your hand. I’ll help you down.","Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there’s pee on the floor.",Pam
24703,"Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?",Yeah.,Pam
24704,Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.,Stop drinking the water! Stop!,Pam
24705,Wow. Late every day this week.,We signed Cici up for this daycare. It’s on the other side of town. The traffic…,Pam
24706,Welcome children.,Were you painting in the dark?,Pam
24707,Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?,I don’t really think we need…,Pam
24708,Oh… lets take the tour Pam.,Yeah.,Pam
24709,"Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child’s imagination that’s Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and… Ms. Fork.",And a soy sauce packet.,Pam
24710,Pam?,"I can’t do this. I don’t have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.",Pam
24711,Everything is going to be ok.,Tell me I’m good at sales.,Pam
24712,"Ok, Dwight. We can’t do that. So why don’t you just tell us what happened?","Yeah, what happened Dwight?",Pam
24713,"You guys know me. You know that I’m not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall…",So what happened?,Pam
24714,Is one of you the office administrator?,I am. I am the office administrator!,Pam
24715,Can I show you a few samples?,"Oh, we’re not interested. We’re not interested at all.",Pam
24716,Office Administrator. So when did this happen?,"A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn’t there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?",Pam
24717,"Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!","Thanks! Yeah, so I’m just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?",Pam
24718,"Totally, that’s great.","I get paid $40,000 per year.",Pam
24719,Great.,"Maybe $50,000.",Pam
24720,"$50,000?","No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.",Pam
24721,The glasses are a little…,I liked them.,Pam
24722,Yeah.,"Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I’ve been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.",Pam
24723,"Right, of course!","And, I haven’t gotten paid yet. I’m not blaming you.",Pam
24724,Thank you so much.,I just think somebody lost the paperwork.,Pam
24725,Oh boy. Can you get every department head’s signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?,Yes. Absolutely. Right away.,Pam
24726,I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh’s home office. All corkboard.,We can do that.,Pam
24727,Right in here?,Easily.,Pam
24728,"I’m back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.",But of course!,Pam
24729,"The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.",So weird that there is no paperwork.,Pam
24730,At all.,"Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.",Pam
24731,"Pam, I don’t want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it’s supposed to be. Can you just admit… admit…",Admit what?,Pam
24732,I don’t want to say it.,Say it.,Pam
24733,Mm-hmm.,"Say that I’m lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.",Pam
24734,"Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.","Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.",Pam
24735,Will do… Can I get one of those name plates… that says Gabe Lewis?,Sure. Anything else?,Pam
24736,Nope.,I’ll get it right away.,Pam
24737,"Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?","Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I’m really sorry.",Pam
24738,"My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could…",We’ll keep looking.,Pam
24739,Really?,"I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.",Pam
24740,"Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.",Yeah.,Pam
24741,Everything’s fine.,We can relax.,Pam
24742,"Fogg’s Asylum , why not?",Sounds like Cece.,Pam
24743,"Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.","Oh, my God! Go, go!",Pam
24744,"Okay, this was pretty simple-",Why are you here?,Pam
24745,"Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.","What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don’t… you know, babies shouldn’t have ice cream, by the way.",Pam
24746,"Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?",You know what? It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter.,Pam
24747,"Okay. Alright, bye Cece.",Okay.,Pam
24748,"Alright, well, we’re never leaving the house again.",Not together!,Pam
24749,"No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn’t a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.",Yeah?,Pam
24750,We could put that in orange juice.,Get it.,Pam
24751,Yeah?,Let’s get our juice on.,Pam
24752,Is that a blow torch?!,No. No no no!,Pam
24753,Interesting choice…,Yes!,Pam
24754,Very very smart.,"Yeah, go away.",Pam
24755,You mean cancer?,"What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.",Pam
24756,What?,"Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don’t know what that is.",Pam
24757,Just admit that your baby was a mistake.,Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.,Pam
24758,I just thought I’d bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That’s all. Anybody?,Andy that’s way too personal of a question.,Pam
24759,"I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can’t wait to wake up every morning.",Okay.,Pam
24760,"I’m on Sheryl Crow’s side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.",Michael!,Pam
24761,Yeah!,"Come on, Michael! Yeah!",Pam
24762,"Oh, my god!",Not the car!,Pam
24763,Tell ’em.,Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.,Pam
24764,What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.,"That’s fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.",Pam
24765,"Yeah, I thought you started it.","No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. You know I have a kid with you, right?",Pam
24766,"I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I…and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.","You don’t look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.",Pam
24767,"No, I don’t have time for this. Are you kidding me?",You don’t?,Pam
24768,But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?,Not really. It’s kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.,Pam
24769,"Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o’clock, I will see you all tomorrow:","Bye, Stanley! Love you!",Pam
24770,To my chickens I’m the Scranton Strangler. Oh-ho! That’s very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute’s mom.,What?,Pam
24771,You’re only one third as beautiful and only half her height.,"I’m supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I’m standing next to Popeye, but… Jim doesn’t want to put his costume on.",Pam
24772,"So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.",We were basically Romeo and Juliet.,Pam
24773,That’s right.,Except where Juliet doesn’t have that great a time and Romeo doesn’t call back after two dates.,Pam
24774,Yikes.,But I’ve learned to love again. He’s a cartoon sailor.,Pam
24775,"Oh, no.",And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?,Pam
24776,Let me put my shoes on.,"Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before… or sit on it.",Pam
24777,"Look, I’m just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.","Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It’s not even a history.",Pam
24778,No! Two or three dates.,It was two.,Pam
24779,Was it two? I thought it was three.,"No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don’t know, you never called me back, so…",Pam
24780,"Well, that does not sound like me.","Yeah? It was though, that’s what happened.",Pam
24781,"Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren’t weird.",Hmm-mm.,Pam
24782,"Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That’s a good line.","Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can’t vote for yourself.",Pam
24783,Still don’t know who I am? I’ll give you a hint. I go over other people’s heads.,"Michael, this is a bad idea.",Pam
24784,What’s a bad idea?,"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",Pam
24785,Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.,"I did. And it’s just one of those things that’s going to keep gnawing at me, like “gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn’t he? I have no idea why.”",Pam
24786,"Hey, man.","Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.",Pam
24787,Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.,"Aww, my hero!",Pam
24788,"Um… kay. Uh, alright.",One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.,Pam
24789,Di-Did you say vampire?,"Oh, no, it’s just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this.",Pam
24790,Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? ‘Cause of the euro.,"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don’t come in if you’re sick.",Pam

24820,That would be nice wouldn’t it?,I can’t even talk about it.,Pam

24888,Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?,We need everything back the way it was.,Pam
24889,"You don’t wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You’ll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink.

We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you.

24895,"You’re a funny guy Pam. What’s the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I’m going to walk down the hall and say “Wow, I can’t believe this is real, but it is.” I can’t wait.",Mmhmm.,Pam
24896,It’s still on a bike path though right?,There’s no building… it doesn’t exist.,Pam
24897,What does that mean?,"I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It’s just this Office Administrator thing, I don’t wanna…",Pam
24898,What?,Fail. I don’t want to fail… again.,Pam
24899,But you didn’t fail.,"And that’s what you said about Art School, and that’s what you said about sales.",Pam
24900,And you didn’t fail those things either.,"Well, I’m not an artist, and I’m not a salesman. So what would you call it?",Pam
24901,I wasn’t here.,What?,Pam
24902,I wasn’t here. It’s a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.,Well thanks.,Pam

24909,Are we over budget?,Nope.,Pam
24910,Hello Kitty’s for girls.,Nashua got mp3 players.,Pam
24911,Yeah!,A party. It’s not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.,Pam
24912,Pam?,"Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.",Pam
24913,It’s not. They’re not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.,"Michael, Michael, wait we don’t have, we don’t have the budget for another party.",Pam

24921,You know Darryl?,Yeah. He works here. We all know him.,Pam
24922,"I should come along, just ’cause he’s my, you know, he’s my hookup.",Cool.,Pam
24923,"It’s cool, Darryl, I’m here too.","Hey, sorry, I really didn’t want to come in. It’s just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we’re hoping we could borrow your truck.",Pam

24925,"Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won’t you be my Christmas tree.","Hey, how about this one?",Pam
24926,"Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?",Maybe. I mean…,Pam
24927,"I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, oh… pick a damn tree already.","Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it’s none of my business, but if I couldn’t have Cece for Christmas, I’d be really upset too.",Pam
24928,"Jada don’t want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn’t as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.","Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.",Pam
24929,Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that’s something to do.,"No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.",Pam
24930,How do I do that?,"Bring her to the party. Yeah, we’ll have Santa, and we’ll play games with her. It’ll be a lot of fun.",Pam
24931,Yes.,You’ll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.,Pam
24932,"Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.",Who told you that?,Pam
24933,So where’s the ring?,"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?",Pam
24934,"Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.","You guys, I don’t think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.",Pam
24935,"Okay, listen, I’m gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose by the end of this year, we’re over.","Wow, an ultimatum.",Pam
24936,Yeah.,It doesn’t really seem like you.,Pam
24937,There’s no connection between the origin story and the quest.,Okay.,Pam
24938,"We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it’s the bear’s quest.","Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?",Pam

24940,"Well, it sounds like you know what you want. It’s also a little derivative of a serias called ‘Bear Man’. Did you look that up?",No.,Pam
24941,So you went homemade this year.,Yup.,Pam
24942,"Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don’t think we can help you out.","No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",Pam

24951,"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",That’s a sad story.,Pam
24952,"Yeah, well, at least he was married.","Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything’s gonna be okay.",Pam
24953,"No, it’s not. It’s not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.","I shouldn’t tell you this, but… AJ won’t commit to Holly. And she’s gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose to her by the end of the year, it’s over.",Pam

24961,Good morning.,"Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year’s resolution on them, I’ll collect them, and then display them on… da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.",Pam

24976,I’m having a little trouble motivating.,"One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.",Pam
24977,Or sooner.,Yeah.,Pam
24978,That’s not a joke.,"But that’s okay. Because it’s not about being perfect, it’s about trying. In fact, why don’t we go around and confess some of the ways that we’ve fudged on some of our resolutions?",Pam
24979,"Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven’t yet. But it’s okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.","Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that’s fine.",Pam

25012,"Hey it’s me. So uh, don’t worry. Everything’s ok.",What’s wrong?,Pam
25013,Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You’re not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?,"Jim, what?",Pam
25014,"Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.",Oh God! What?!,Pam

25016,"Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here’s the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.",Understood.,Pam
25017,And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.,Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a “Ask Pam Beasley”. … Did the phone cut off?,Pam

25021,"Yeah, which one?",Well the first one has a surprise factor. “I’m a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!”,Pam
25022,No no. No no no.,"But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.",Pam
25023,Keep it real.,"You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.",Pam
25024,Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.,"Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.",Pam
25025,Has Michael checked in?,"Oh, hey Dwight.",Pam
25026,I asked you a question.,"No, he hasn’t.",Pam
25027,Goodbye.,"No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought…",Pam
25028,This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.,"Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it’s convent, I just thought since you are out…",Pam
25029,"Pam, I’m obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.","Ok, well it wasn’t obvious so…",Pam
25030,Ok. I got one.,Yeah?,Pam

25036,She was about to turn 97.,"At least she lived a very long and I’m sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you’re ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we’re thinking about you.",Pam

25043,Shh.,"Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue… station. And what else was there?",Pam
25044,"Um, bottomless champagne.","Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?",Pam
25045,"I get it. Andy’s slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.",Yeah. What? Us?,Pam
25046,Did it!,Yeah!,Pam
25047,"What, are you talking about me and Holly?",Yeah!,Pam
25048,Mm-hmm.,"You know, you’re in a meeting, and nobody knows that you’ve had sex there, except for you and him.",Pam

25051,You wanted to have sex in my office.,No.,Pam
25052,"Hey, you don’t have to…",That was so embarrassing. I’m gonna die.,Pam
25053,"No, because the office isn’t what I’d consider a romantic place.","Besides, we have something those other people don’t have, which is a home and a bed.",Pam
25054,What?,No.,Pam
25055,No. We took a walk.,We took a walk.,Pam
25056,Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.,"We’re all in it, from like years and years ago. It’s like a home movie.",Pam
25057,"Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!","Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn’t go well. We thought it was a comedy. Everything pointed to it being a comedy.",Pam
25058,"Sweet, I will go invite Holly.","Okay everyone, I know we’re really excited to see this movie that everybody’s in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let’s stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we’ll have a pure fun day! Okay?",Pam

25068,"Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So…","Ok, but listen. We just don’t have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.",Pam
25069,"Well Andy’s desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it’s just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but…","Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",Pam
25070,"Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.","See, this is what I’m talking about.",Pam
25071,What are you gonna play mange on faster?,Sorry Andy.,Pam
25072,"It’s crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.",What? Erin is that true?,Pam
25073,"I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.","Erin, it’s not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It’s not yours to give away.",Pam
25074,"Pam, when I’m freaking out, I just sorta step back and-","I’m not freaking out, Andy.",Pam
25075,"-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?","Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?",Pam
25076,That’s interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.,Switch the computers back Andy.,Pam

25079,Pam. Can I talk to you in private?,I don’t know if there’s really a private place in this office.,Pam
25080,Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.,You did that?,Pam
25081,Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we’re a little late.,Okay. When did people sign-,Pam
25082,"Mind if I close the door? What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.","Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?",Pam
25083,You humiliated me in front of every body!,"Okay, well I didn’t think about it like that. It’s just, I can’t do anything about it. I can’t replace that one unless that computer breaks.",Pam
25084,"I mean, it’s pretty broken already.","Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.",Pam
25085,"No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I’m gonna make myself cry.","Andy, this is the deal we made.",Pam
25086,That’s probably good. That’s enough.,We should break this hinge maybe.,Pam
25087,"Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?",Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!,Pam
25088,"Where’d you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?","Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse.",Pam

25092,Really? ‘Cause I think maybe I saw five.,Three.,Pam
25093,No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.,Oh.,Pam
25094,"Oh, yikes.",It’s cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.,Pam
25095,It’s good that its cold it will drive business inside.,The signs will drive people inside.,Pam
25096,"Oh, which one is decaf?",Michael! Michael!,Pam
25097,Hi.,Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.,Pam
25098,"Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I’m gonna run out of gas.",Why do you need more gas?,Pam
25099,"Well, I’m writing a message.",Is it a good message or a bad message?,Pam
25100,I’m asking Holly a question in fire.,Are you proposing!?,Pam
25101,Maybe.,Wow.,Pam

25114,Heres the ring.,Holy s*** is that real?,Pam
25115,Is she not going to like that?,No she’s going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.,Pam
25116,That mush have been a surprise when… at the gas station you proposed.,No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..,Pam
25117,I just… it’s terrifying.,She’s not gonna say no.,Pam
25118,Cause it’s a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.,You were scared?,Pam

25128,I love when people say like crack when they’ve obviously never done crack.,"Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?",Pam
25129,"I don’t know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.","You’re right, you’re right. I’m a middle class broad.",Pam
25130,"I just don’t understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.","Yeah… Hey, Erin, everything okay?",Pam
25131,Please! Sorry. Get in. Sorry sorry sorry.,What’s wrong?,Pam

25133,"I, really don’t like spending time with him.","Don’t you think it’s better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?",Pam
25134,I think I’m gonna go.,What?,Pam
25135,"I can’t just dump him Pam, I’m not like you, I can’t be mean.","Wait, when am I…? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don’t love him. Just be honest with him.",Pam

25137,I gotta go do this.,Why?,Pam
25138,"So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it’d be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well…","Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!",Pam
25139,"No, no. You’re being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.","Let’s grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started.",Pam

25153,"I know what you’re thinking, but it’s not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they’re not just guy’s fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.","Okay, don’t turn this into some feminist issue.",Pam
25154,"As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.","You know what, I think we should get some other input.",Pam

25167,What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?,What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?,Pam
25168,How could I not see it? You’re so right.,Why don’t you talk to him about it?,Pam
25169,"And say what? “Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?”",Why don’t you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?,Pam

25177,I’m coming.,Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?,Pam
25178,"Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let’s see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee.

25234,"Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn’t the fact that I’m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!","I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, “Who’s that receptionist? I like her.” Now I’m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you’re like, “Oh, loser.”",Pam
25235,"C’mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?",Oh. Oh God.,Pam

25250,I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?,That sounds nice.,Pam
25251,You have a walking buddy.,I do.,Pam
25252,"These are incentives. It’s how we’re gonna double growth. Now, you’re probably all asking yourselves: “Well, how does this work?”","Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.",Pam

25254,Yeah!,Yeah! Whoo!,Pam
25255,"Yeah. Big sale. Don’t worry about it though, I don’t really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though… Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald…can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much.",Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman’s?,Pam

25291,I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.,"Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.",Pam
25292,"What happened, Pam?","Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn’t believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there’s no one there. So, I tell the cook my story…",Pam

25303,Thank you.,Jim doesn’t let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?,Pam
25304,"Careful, whoa. First of all, it’s not like I think that’s going to help the Eagles win.",Really.,Pam
25305,"Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, “Mom, there’s a ghost in my closet.” Now, you say one of two things – one, “You’re just having a bad dream,” or two, “Let’s go see what it was.”","I’m not gonna freak her out, Jim.",Pam
25306,Ok.,"I’m not gonna lie to her, either.",Pam

25340,"And I’m telling you, I don’t.",You don’t find Cathy attractive?,Pam
25341,That’s just absurd.,"Yes, because she’s hot, right?",Pam

25343,"Meh… you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you’re at an all-time low.",Hmm. I think Jim’s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.,Pam
25344,You think Jim’s lying? That’s so cute. I know he’s lying.,Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.,Pam

25351,So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.,Let’s just see how we feel when we get there.,Pam
25352,"It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy’s hot.",Hmm.,Pam
25353,"Oh, I stand corrected.",I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?,Pam

25357,I don’t see what’s so ugly about him. He’s got the broad face of a brewer.,Jim’s on to me.,Pam

25359,Just ugly enough to have deniability.,Yep.,Pam
25360,I’m gonna write something mean on his wall.,"No, Kelly, don’t.",Pam

25362,"Okay, just shut it.",Is he puffing out his chest?,Pam
25363,I can’t tell. It’s unnaturally sunken. Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?,No. Maybe he just said something funny.,Pam
25364,"Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.",I think he’s just making her laugh.,Pam
25365,Time for me to find out.,Why’s he making her laugh so much?,Pam
25366,"Yeah, take your time.",Okay.,Pam
25367,"Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-","Oscar, Cathy has a question!",Pam
25368,"Sorry, um, I’ll just go ask Oscar.",Yeah?,Pam
25369,You okay?,Why won’t you just admit that she’s attractive? It’s kind of annoying that you won’t say it.,Pam
25370,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?","Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that’s where we are now.",Pam
25371,Really?,This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.,Pam
25372,Si.,"Wait, that’s it? That’s the question you’re going to ask him?",Pam
25373,"Yep, he’s lying.","Ah, see, was that so hard?",Pam
25374,I am not lying.,Really?,Pam
25375,"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he’s lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?","Wait, what?",Pam
25376,"Look at the numbers. Every single time, it’s come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.","Jim, you have high blood pressure.",Pam

25378,"Yeah, but I don’t smoke.",When was the last time you went to the doctor?,Pam

25458,"Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring ’em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!","Yes, the conference room is set up. I’ve got pens, I’ve got paper, I’ve got a whiteboard, we are good to go!",Pam
25459,Say what?,We are good to goooo!,Pam
25460,Say what?,We’re good to goooo!,Pam
25461,Tonight we’re staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.,"Yes, of course, we could’ve just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.",Pam
25462,"Play it cool, man. She’ll come around.","No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would’ve happened with me and Jim if he didn’t put himself out there.",Pam
25463,"Yeah, but… My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.",My husband would tell you to go for it.,Pam
25464,It has been delivered.,"That’s it, last one.",Pam
25465,"Here’s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam…",That’s true.,Pam
25466,"They had, uh… weapons.",Weapons.,Pam
25467,I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.,But these were not the kind of people who use their words.,Pam
25468,"Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.",Thank goodness he was there.,Pam
25469,"No, no, no, no, no, we don’t need to call the police. They’ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone’s business, right, Pam?",Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.,Pam
25470,Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.,1-8-5-0-5.,Pam
25471,There. That chubby one.,I just had a baby.,Pam
25472,Yesterday?,Wow.,Pam
25473,Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your “thin” girlfriend.,How ‘bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?,Pam
25474,"Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly… come on…. Ow! God! My good eye!","Oh boy. Oh no, I’m not laughing at you. I’m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier — yesterday. This morning.",Pam
25475,It’s a photo of all of us.,"Aw, that’s so sweet!",Pam
25476,"No, no, I think it was more like, ‘you know, I liked him, but I don’t anymore because he did a bad job, so I’m definitely gonna yell at him’.",Robert doesn’t talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.,Pam
25477,I tried. He will not listen.,Did you actually try your hardest?,Pam
25478,Stanley’s very upset that we’re leaving Florida. But he would back me up.,"If Dwight’s about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That’s all you can do.",Pam
25479,"Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.",Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.,Pam
25480,"Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?","We’ll find another receptionist. I mean, that’s easy. We’ll be fine.",Pam
25481,Good to be back.,"Hey, stranger!",Pam
25482,Hey.,"Aw, I missed you.",Pam
25483,I missed you.,Aw.,Pam
25484,Wow. It’s the end of an era.,"Did a good job, Buddy. Now it’s time to come home.",Pam
25485,Mm.,What?,Pam
25486,"I- I said I’m Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I’m Toby.",You messed up saying your name?,Pam
25487,"So no one can tell me what’s going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. But why, m’lady? Because I am your new manager.","Robert, is Nellie our new manager?",Pam
25488,Performance reviews.,How can you give us performance reviews if you don’t know us?,Pam
25489,Any luck?,No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.,Pam
25490,Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn’t have to work?,I like working here.,Pam
25491,"So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I’m fairly certain you’re going to like it.",Phyllis.,Pam
25492,"So, Pamela, I’m going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.","Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager’s position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I’m easy.",Pam
25493,"That’s not really what you want. What you want is a good night’s sleep, working mother of two.","Whoa, that’s kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?",Pam
25494,"Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for– what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?","Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn’t is because I’m breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn’t like a bottle.",Pam
25495,You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?,No.,Pam
25496,"Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There’s a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I’ll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.",I think… you’re a witch.,Pam
25497,"I think you’re amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: “I’m amazing.”",I’m amazing.,Pam
25498,"Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.",It’s nice. It’s funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.,Pam
25499,Stanley doesn’t have a moustache.,Yeah he does.,Pam
25500,"Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I’m not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.","Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?",Pam
25501,"Oh, I don’t know. Now I think he doesn’t.",Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!,Pam
25502,‘Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don’t stick our noses in other people’s business.,"Okay, which one of these looks more right?",Pam
25503,Yes!,"Welcome back, Stanley.",Pam
25504,"“Good morning, Robert,” says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. Pam!",Oh!,Pam
25505,"Is this a video conference you’re having with “Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz”?","Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.",Pam
25506,I can’t believe he’s making us throw a party for her.,"I know, right?",Pam
25507,On purpose.,Phyllis!,Pam
25508,"Excuse me, one second. Hi.","Hey, what’s up?",Pam
25509,That’s moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.,"So we’re planning this party for Nellie, and we’re gonna make it really bad.",Pam
25510,Sounds like every other party.,"No. We’re gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.",Pam
25511,Oh! Hire a magician.,What?,Pam
25512,Trust me.,Okay.,Pam
25513,"You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let’s give up on all this mean stuff.","What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don’t have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.",Pam
25514,"Absolutely. Yeah. Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It’s way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.","Oh, okay. Okay, I will.",Pam
25515,We’re going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It’s gonna make everyone sick.,Or what if…,Pam
25516,Okay.,"We discuss… the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. Not mean.",Pam
25517,We’re in far too deep. We can’t change course at this point.,What are you talking about? Yes we can.,Pam
25518,Yeah!,"No, that’s a great idea. Let’s have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?",Pam
25519,"Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.",‘Cause there’s someone already here named Pam.,Pam
25520,-that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just… disappear?,Oh!,Pam
25521,But I never could seem to figure out those knots.,"That’s not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.",Pam
25522,Yes ma’am.,I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.,Pam
25523,What? That ain’t right.,"Yeah, he came and went.",Pam
25524,"Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? You don’t think he could’ve used… it couldn’t have been…",Let’s just- let’s go.,Pam
25525,Time’s almost up. How many are left?,"Just one. “This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.”",Pam
25526,What do you mean?,"You know, like aren’t some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?",Pam
25527,"…and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call.","Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don’t want to bother you any more than we already have.",Pam
25528,"Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and… oh, that’s it.",Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they’d be good together.,Pam
25529,Why?,But she’s had a bad influence. She’s like an addict. And I just had to get her clean.,Pam
25530,"Don’t shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated ’cause the baby’s crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can’t do that.",Don’t shake our baby?,Pam
25531,Yeah.,"Okay. I’d never heard that before. So, thank you.",Pam
25532,"Oh, my God.","Yeah, I’m glad you said something.",Pam
25533,"Hey, um, what’s the deal with this guy? He’s really into Kelly, huh?","Yeah, they’re really great together.",Pam
25534,"He’s so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, “Kelly, that will be the color of our children.”","Yeah, he’s so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?",Pam
25535,"Okay, so I-","Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.",Pam
25536,What happened?,That a couple of times-,Pam
25537,"Um… I don’t… Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we’d had sex so many times already, I was exhausted…","Okay, stop.",Pam
25538,"Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.",All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.,Pam
25539,"Well that’s your opinion and it’s her opinion, but it’s not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.","Fair enough. Um… I don’t think you’re a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I’ve said this to you before: I don’t like you very much.",Pam
25540,"Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can’t even read it. My heart couldn’t handle it.","Oh, no, no, no.",Pam
25541,"Oh, come on.","Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.",Pam
25542,No. It would cause me too much pain.,Read through the pain. Be strong.,Pam
25543,You are toxic! You are toxic!,Boo!,Pam
25544,"Well you do a lot, so just don’t. Thank you. I know that I haven’t always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.","Barf! Ugh, you suck!",Pam
25545,"Not at all, can we go?","“Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.”",Pam
25546,Second line.,“He is a drifter out to sea.”,Pam
25547,"“And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.”","It’s just so dumb. But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft…",Pam
25548,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.","Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?",Pam
25549,Smokey’s dead.,"Smokey, the bear?",Pam

25551,"Okay, I’m not… I’m not playing this game, Pam. Not today.",I don’t think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you’re just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music,Pam
25552,Wow! Look at that! It says he’s actually playing State College. That’s only three hours away!,"Oh my God, Ryan! That’s perfect! You have to go!",Pam
25553,Tickets are 250 bucks.,250 dollars is nothing to the world’s biggest Smokey Robinson fan.,Pam
25554,"How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That’s not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.",Tears of a clown!,Pam
25555,That’s how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male “hanging out”. Call the cops!,"Dwight, I don’t think he’s going to hurt anybody.",Pam
25556,"guys, everything is fine! I’m just here to pick up Erin. We’re going to the Fundraiser.","Oh, great! That sounds good!",Pam
25557,The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that’s shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.,Sounds like you’re doing alright.,Pam
25558,I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!,Oh my god!,Pam
25559,"Okay, what was this look?",Whoa!,Pam
25560,"What happened, did he do it?",Are you– Twice! For real?,Pam
25561,"Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn’t Downton Abbey.",Life is Downton Abbey.,Pam
25562,This is interesting.,Hm-hmm.,Pam
25563,what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.,Or you proved that he thinks you’re gay.,Pam
25564,He does not think Jim’s gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.,"Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!",Pam
25565,This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me,"Absolutely, it’s awesome–",Pam
25566,"Okay well, Andy, listen. It’s okay if you don’t feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.","Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!",Pam
25567,"My dog Ruby doesn’t do anything, she just lays there all day! She’s so chill.",What do you feed her?,Pam
25568,"Doesn’t really poop. It’s perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.",Does she smell?,Pam
25569,"Pam, when’s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn’t hold the memories in?","Oh, it was this summer –",Pam
25570,"Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.","Um, I am a little busy.",Pam
25571,"Yes, ‘course. Why don’t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.","Yeah, I can make you a list.",Pam

25575,Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.,What do you want from me?,Pam
25576,Shopaholic.,Sounds like it.,Pam
25577,"This is Annie from second nests. I’m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we’re gonna hold out for that.","Okay, that’s enough.",Pam
25578,"Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.","No, no, no!",Pam
25579,"No, come on.","Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They’re all deleted.",Pam

25590,Pam? No!,"What? Honey, we talked about this.",Pam
25591,"No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight’s photo studio slash trap.","Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.",Pam
25592,"No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.","No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?",Pam

25611,"Oh, yeah","Yes, Jim’s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.",Pam
25612,Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.,And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.,Pam

25614,Yeah,"Don’t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.",Pam
25615,"Well we’re more following you guys, to see how you turn out.","Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don’t think anything’s gonna change in our lives now.

25616,"Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.",What are you doing?,Pam
25617,Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it’s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.,I will?,Pam

25651,That didn’t happen. You would’ve told me right away.,"Yeah, I would’ve. What about you? Come on, there’s gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven’t had the chance to tell me.",Pam

25766,Cece can’t spell her name.,"Oh, actually she can.",Pam

25768,"Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.",Um… “A”… “X”? I don’t — you got me.,Pam
25769,Don’t patronize me.,I’m so sorry. I hate this. You’re better.,Pam

25780,You paint wall now?,Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that…,Pam
25781,You paint now.,It’s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.,Pam
25782,That’s cheating.,I could get us a complaint.,Pam
25783,You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn’t fart on a butterfly.,"No, I wouldn’t. I can’t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I’d like to try.",Pam
25784,"Remember, you’re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.","Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I’m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider.

25852,Why don’t you come along and tell him yourself?,"Ha ha. That’d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get… What do you get? Oh my god!

25855,"I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy’s job in the bag until my interview.","Well, you shouldn’t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.",Pam

25860,"By the way, Jim talks about you all the time.",That’s sweet that he talks about me.,Pam
25861,It’s too bad he still hast to work part time in Scranton though…,"Well, that’s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.",Pam
25862,So I’m like a three year old girl in this scenario…,Say they don’t hire you. It’s not like you’re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.,Pam
25863,"And I’d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I’m… I’m not so sure I’d like living in Philadelphia.",Right? Thank you! It’s just Philly. Everyone’s acting like it’s New York or Paris or London.,Pam

25876,Just – I don’t wanna make assumptions based on people’s physical appearances.,"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?",Pam
25877,"Yeah, but Jim, Dwight’s a weirdo. We can’t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.","Hey, I’m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim’s away. I’m in a position where I’m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.",Pam
25878,Why you make trees into bushes? You don’t make paper from bushes.,"Hide, they’re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don’t you go up and get one?",Pam

25887,"Who, me?",Us.,Pam
25888,"Absolutely, I do.","Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I’ll distract him, you take that.",Pam
25889,"Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that’s great.",...,Pam
25890,...,...,Pam
25891,"Welcome to the club, pig!","No, Dwight!",Pam

25893,"You’re telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?",Yeah.,Pam
25894,"Let’s go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!",I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.,Pam
25895,I thought that’s what you were doing.,"Yeah, but this is different.",Pam
25896,Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?,"I don’t think so, but they put paint where I didn’t want paint. So…",Pam
25897,I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.,"Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is… OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.",Pam
25898,"Pam, what can be done?",Yes. Thank you. Let’s answer that question.,Pam
25899,I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.,What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn’t just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don’t you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.,Pam
25900,David Wallace called this meeting?,"Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.",Pam
25901,"Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.","No, no. Come on, guys. Don’t go.",Pam
25902,"Pam, I’ll help you.",You will?,Pam
25903,"If there’s anything I hate worse than art, it’s crime.",Thank you.,Pam
25904,"I am in too, Pam.",Yeah?,Pam
25905,"Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.",Great.,Pam
25906,"Well, this is getting us nowhere.","We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.",Pam
25907,We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. Nate. Your mother is dying.,"See, I feel bad about that.",Pam
25908,"Gum’s gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it’s just too minty. It’s like they’re literally trying to hurt…",Tell us who defaced the mural!,Pam
25909,He did it.,All right. You can go. Give him his gum.,Pam
25910,"So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?","Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I’ve done anything to offend you. I’m sure it isn’t easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.",Pam
25911,I’m sorry I didn’t like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny.,"Well, I didn’t think that butt was funny.",Pam
25912,"Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours.",What was that?,Pam
25913,"You know what? You people can’t fire me. So, screw you.",Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?,Pam
25914,"Oh, your little feelings party didn’t work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.",We should just take him down.,Pam
25915,Wait. Are you saying…,I’m saying we should go scorched earth on that guy’s face.,Pam
25916,He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that’s important to him.,Yes!,Pam
25917,A little eye for an eye action.,Yes!,Pam
25918,Go all Hammurabi on this clown.,We need an infiltrator.,Pam
25919,I know just the man for the job.,Clark?,Pam
25920,"OK, boss. Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you’re smarter than this.","Shh, shh.",Pam
25921,This is never gonna work.,Shh. Remember your lines.,Pam
25922,"He’s not my hire, but I know who he is.",OK. What does he like? What’s important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or…,Pam
25923,What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?,"Yeah, something like that.",Pam
25924,I know he loves his pick up truck.,"Oh, great! His truck!",Pam
25925,Great. Get the plate number.,OK. Do you know the plate… never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?,Pam
25926,"Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband’s like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?",Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. Come on.,Pam
25927,"Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I’m drawing your mural on Frank’s truck’s butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.","Aw, Dwight. That’s really sweet.",Pam
25928,Let’s see yours.,"Oh, no. Um, I, I’m embarrassed. It’s stupid.",Pam
25929,This is amazing! Frank! And he’s leaving a trail of poops?,Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.,Pam
25930,I saw that. That’s great!,Yeah. I feel better.,Pam
25931,"Good. I’m glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.","I know. You miss Angela, don’t you?",Pam
25932,Lady! My truck? You had no right!,"No, you had no right!",Pam
25933,"It’s a $40,000 truck!",So? You started it!,Pam
25934,"Hey, hey, hey!",Whoa.,Pam
25935,"No. No, it’s…","You shouldn’t be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.",Pam
25936,"It’s all good. I knew what I was doing. It’s… I’m sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.",Forget about my mural. It’s stupid.,Pam
25937,"No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy’s an animal. I’m glad they’re firing him too.","It’s crazy. Brian, I’m so sorry.",Pam
25938,"Look. I don’t, I don’t wanna put myself where I don’t belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I’ll be there for you.","Thanks, Brian.",Pam
25939,"It’s like magic. Or, it’s like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.",Alakazam!,Pam
25940,"By the way, they do need an extra day next week.","And, poof! He disappears.",Pam
25941,They are terrible.,"Oh, hey, don’t fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.",Pam
25942,Oh my god. That’s so romantic.,It’s with Brian and Alyssa.,Pam
25943,Oh my god. That’s less romantic.,"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.",Pam
25944,"Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That’s good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?",That sounds nice.,Pam
25945,Hey.,Sorry we’re late.,Pam
25946,"Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.","Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.",Pam
25947,What?,He’s on a no carb thing. Supposedly.,Pam
25948,"It’s, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.",Yeah.,Pam
25949,"It’s fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I’m fully available.","Well, my dad can’t hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.",Pam
25950,"That’s… OK, great. Does he pay well?",Where’s Alyssa?,Pam
25951,"Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa’s, she’s not gonna make it today.",Oh.,Pam
25952,"Yeah. That’s the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn’t until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it’s over. I’m sorry, this is… oh my god, OK. We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.",Yeah.,Pam
25953,"I don’t know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don’t know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.",I didn’t tell you about the crying because I didn’t want you to know how upset I was. Because it would’ve stressed you out and you’re always saying how much you don’t want more stress.,Pam
25954,"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.",It’s not Brian’s fault.,Pam
25955,"No, you’re right. And, and I’m not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don’t have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn’t there. So, let’s just forget about it.",OK.,Pam
25956,You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.,Oh?,Pam
25957,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I’m sure you have stuff to do. So we can just… I don’t know, drop me at the bus station?",Are you sure?,Pam
25958,I just feel like we’re gonna fight.,Yeah.,Pam
25959,So… how ’bout let’s not?,OK.,Pam
25960,"Oh, um. Happy Valentine’s Day. Sorry, I didn’t have time to wrap it.",Wow. I didn’t know you kept this.,Pam
25961,"Yeah, yeah.",Thank you.,Pam
25962,No problem.,I don’t think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.,Pam
25963,You really wanna fight on Valentine’s Day?,"Yeah, I do.",Pam
25964,Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh,He sounds like a wounded animal.,Pam
25965,I’m the same way with horny people.,Ok.,Pam
25966,Where are you going?,"Uh, not on a three month boat trip.",Pam

25972,"Of course, anything for Team Halpert. You’re gonna crush it, Pam.",Thanks.,Pam
25973,"You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.","Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.",Pam
25974,Call you right back. What were you saying?,Ha ha.,Pam
25975,"I’ve gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You’re gonna crush it, you’re gonna smash it. OK, good luck!",Bye.,Pam
25976,"… talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting…Is that her? Hey guys! Say something.",Hello.,Pam
25977,"Hi, I’m Mark.","Hi, Pam, hello.",Pam
25978,"I’m the horrible boss around here, but please don’t hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. D’Jango! I don’t agree with the use of the “N” word in that movie. It’s, it’s too soon.",I’m Pam Halpert.,Pam
25979,"Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition! Kids in the Hall. Just, it’s not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers.",Oh my god.,Pam
25980,This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom. From The Smurfs movie.,"Yeah, I’ve seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I’ve actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-",Pam
25981,"What does this say here? To ti te per tat… what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it.","Oh, cause it was upside down.",Pam

25983,Unlike some of these people around here.,"Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-",Pam
25984,"Yeah, we don’t have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and here’s why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You don’t jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean…you think they like me, Pam?",Yes.,Pam
25985,"What if Bob Dylan was your boss? I’m gonna do Dylan! Pam Halpert is my name, and I’ve been at Dunder Mifflin for seven years? Eight years? Eight years, man. Got the Dunder Mifflin blues. Got the Pam Halpert blues. Got the pra- went to the Pratt Institute…You have children?","Two children, yes.",Pam
25986,"Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don’t- not allowed to ask. So…",I am not pr-,Pam
25987,You’re not.,"Pregnant, no.",Pam
25988,I didn’t ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.,Wow.,Pam
25989,"Don’t be afraid, it’s a different chair. I don’t want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-",I’m sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.,Pam
25990,"It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.","So, kinda like a receptionist.",Pam
25991,"Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it’s less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?",Yes.,Pam
25992,"Hey, how’d the interview go?","Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-",Pam

25998,Oh man. I’m so sorry. Are you alright?,"Oh, yeah. I’m more than alright. There’s just nothing to celebrate.",Pam
25999,Are you kidding? We’re in Philly. We’re having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It’s from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.,You’re very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.,Pam
26000,Tell me about the cologne. How much?,"Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.",Pam

26006,It’s fascinating.,He said he can’t help but tear up when he looks at it. It’s like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.,Pam
26007,"That’s amazing. Well, listen. You can’t win ’em all, right?",Mmhm.,Pam
26008,"So, next interview has to be better.",I don’t know.,Pam
26009,What do you mean? Of course it will. You’re amazing.,"I know. It’s just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don’t know, I don’t know if I want, um, I don’t know if I want this.",Pam
26010,Huh. This is a little out of left field.,"Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.",Pam

26012,Who’s this guy?,… bad.,Pam
26013,"Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff. OK. Uh, where to begin. Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that’s why I acted out. Pam, I’m sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I’m sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, this kid in a few years.","Todd, you’re just saying insults in the form of an apology.",Pam
26014,"Why can’t I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology’s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that’s why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place ‘Nipples’.",I think it’s called ‘Nibbles’.,Pam
26015,"Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? There you go.","Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don’t eat the cupcake.",Pam
26016,"I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they’re dense. But, they’re also really fluffy.","We can’t let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?",Pam
26017,"I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.",Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?,Pam
26018,"They do. It’s awful. And, it’s getting worse every day.","So, it really is just about the cupcakes.",Pam
26019,You don’t know that.,"Kevin, um, let’s think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?",Pam
26020,James Bond was a spy.,Yes. He was a good spy.,Pam
26021,"What, Pam?",Wait!,Pam
26022,He’s gone. It’s just a cupcake now.,"No, no. It’s the principle of the thing.",Pam
26023,Hey.,"Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn’t know, it’s OK.",Pam
26024,"I don’t care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.",Phyllis!,Pam
26025,Packer laced the cupcakes.,No!,Pam
26026,Some of us got both.,Oh my god! Is everyone OK?,Pam
26027,Nope. I did not see you either.,Wow. He is officially the worst human being.,Pam
26028,Ah.,"But, Kevin that’s…",Pam
26029,It’s porn.,Yeah.,Pam
26030,"Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it’s not OK to do this in public.","Be careful. I pulled my mom’s dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.",Pam
26031,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?",She’s listening to 50 Shades of Grey.,Pam
26032,Oh man.,I wonder if she’ll start calling you ‘Jim’.,Pam
26033,"Oh boy, please don’t. Let’s not let that happen.",Um.,Pam
26034,What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?,You’re- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?,Pam
26035,"Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies’ first baseman.","Oh, oh OK.",Pam
26036,"Yeah, yeah. Exactly.","Um, Ok. Well?",Pam
26037,"Yeah. So, uh, I’ll uh, talk to you later?","Yeah, sounds good. Ok.",Pam
26038,Ok great.,Ok.,Pam
26039,Bye.,Bye.,Pam
26040,"Oh my god, is that you and Jim?",Uh huh.,Pam
26041,"Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? Yikes. That is awful.",It wasn’t so bad.,Pam
26042,"Hey guys, I just found another promo. It’s in Danish. I guess it’s gonna start airing in Denmark.",Oh my god!,Pam
26043,"Ok, Pam. Why don’t you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.",Brian?,Pam
26044,Yeah.,"Yeah, I guess I could.",Pam
26045,"Oh, hey!",Hey!,Pam
26046,Hi.,"Hi, um. I’m sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?",Pam
26047,"No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It’s good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-","Oh my gosh, please, don’t.",Pam
26048,"Yeah, no, I- actually it’s always like this. Do you want to go outside? It’s a little less cluttered out there.","Sure, yeah. Yeah.",Pam
26049,Let me grab a couple drinks.,"OK. Oh wow, you have a nice view.",Pam
26050,"Alright, that’s for you.","Oh, thank you.",Pam
26051,Cheers.,Cheers.,Pam
26052,So…,So..,Pam
26053,What brings you by?,"Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.",Pam
26054,"Oh yeah, that’s right.",Yeah. It’s kinda crazy.,Pam
26055,"Yeah, it is.","See all this like old stuff, like um, there’s that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?",Pam
26056,"Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.","Yeah, wasn’t that neat?",Pam
26057,"Yeah, it was cool.","Yeah, and there’s this one when we were listening to music and it’s like, it’s like w were in love and we didn’t even know we were in love and it’s…but- Do you think Jim’s changed?",Pam
26058,Um…,I’m sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-,Pam
26059,"No no, it’s-","I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he’s- I just feel like…he’s so into his work right now and….I don’t know, am I crazy?",Pam
26060,"No, you’re not crazy.","Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they’re kinda freaking out. Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-",Pam
26061,Yeah.,"You know, stuff people didn’t intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.",Pam
26062,They want to know how much what?,How much stuff you got.,Pam
26063,Pretty much everything.,"Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?",Pam
26064,"They’ve got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so…no if you were around there, they got you.",So we basically had no privacy for ten years.,Pam
26065,"That’s not really true, I mean-","Um…yeah, I gotta, I gotta go.",Pam
26066,"Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I’m sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.",No I think you explained it.,Pam
26067,...,I hope you got sound on everything. I’d love a DVD of that.,Pam
26068,"Oh, your mom’s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? Oh, um, Embassy Suites. “Do Not Disturb” sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.",I wish.,Pam
26069,"What, then?","Oh, nothing that exciting.",Pam
26070,Marriage counseling?,Hmm.,Pam
26071,Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?,"You know, Jim’s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.",Pam
26072,Mmm.,"I mean, we’ve having issues. It can’t hurt to talk about them, right?",Pam
26073,Ow! Ow!,I didn’t see you! You should have yelled “Crossing!”,Pam
26074,I’m sorry!,"Ok, so is that my spot?",Pam
26075,Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.,Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.,Pam
26076,No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.,And we have homework.,Pam
26077,"Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other’s sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam’s been doing to run the house while I’m in Philly.",And we’re also supposed to speak our truths.,Pam
26078,Mmhm.,"Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn’t have had this opportunity for couple’s therapy.",Pam
26079,"Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let’s get it done tomorrow. Carla Fern got me a gig.",Hey!,Pam
26080,An Earl Grey tea for the lady.,"Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.",Pam
26081,"Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn’t out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.","Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There’s a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.",Pam
26082,"Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.",I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.,Pam
26083,Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.,"Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-",Pam
26084,"Hey that’s work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.","Uh, to speak my truth, I’d appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. I appreciate the sacrifice.",Pam
26085,"Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that’s a little unfair.","Really? I’ve been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That’s really your truth?",Pam
26086,"Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.",We’re not high.,Pam
26087,"I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we’re making progress. So I’m really sorry that I have to go but let’s keep at this. Ok?",Ok.,Pam
26088,Thanks.,"Alright, have a good trip.",Pam
26089,Bye.,Bye.,Pam
26090,"I’m taking some time off from work—well, my other work—because we needed it.",It’s great.,Pam
26091,It’s great.,The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.,Pam
26092,But that doesn’t matter. This does. It’s the only thing that matters. We’ve had some really nice days together.,"Nice morning, too.",Pam
26093,"Right. Well, I’m here to sell paper.",Wow.,Pam
