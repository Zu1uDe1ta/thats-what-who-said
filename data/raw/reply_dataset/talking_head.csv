All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You’re a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I’m sorry. OK. I’m sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so… She had a very low voice.

1,"People say I am the best boss. They go, “God we’ve never worked in a place like this before. You’re hilarious.” “And you get the best out of us.” I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.",Michael
2,"Corporate really doesn’t really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because… well, not because I’m scared of her. Because I’m not. But, um… Yeah.",Michael
3,"Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don’t see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.",Michael

5,"People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope… Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it’s really beyond words. It’s really incalculable.",Michael
6,"What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It’s the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, “Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?” Wow. Wow. Didn’t work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.",Michael
7,"Today is diversity day and someone’s going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It’s something that I’ve been pushing, that I’ve been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it’s very important that we have this. I’m very, very excited.",Michael
8,"How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I’m white and Chris is black?",Michael

I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness…” Open-mindedness, is that even a word? “…into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.” He’s going to lose it when he reads that.",Michael
11,"Hi. I’m Michael Scott. I’m in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I’m also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, “If you’re a racist, I will attack you with the North.” And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.",Michael
12,"I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore… Don’t look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and… Take a card, take a card, any card. Um… And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so… I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn’t just an exercise. This is real life. And… I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get ‘er done.",Michael
13,Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There’s this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I’m not going to do it but it’s…,Michael
14,"You’ll notice I didn’t have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. “Too soon for Arabs.” Maybe next year. Um… You know, the ball’s in their court.",Michael
15,Talk like you’re talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going.,Michael
16,"The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That’s what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um… Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.",Michael
17,"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we’ve talked about that already.",Michael
18,"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn’t matter. The point is, they’re not unhappy anymore. They’re out there thinking, “Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He’s cool. I… what a great guy. I love him. I…",Michael
19,"OK, so I don’t know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?",Michael

23,"It looks like there’s gonna be downsizing. And it’s part of my job, but… blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, “You’re fired.” “You’re foir-ed. Uh, you’re foir-ed.” It just makes people sad, and an office can’t function that way. No way. “You’re foir-ed.” I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, “You’re hired, and you can work here as long as you want.” But that’s unrealistic, so…",Michael
24,"Can you get her? She’s right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this… is Meredith’s card. Happy Bird-Day. Um, let’s see. Jim, Jim wrote, “Meredith, I heard you’re turning 46, but, come on, you’re an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.” Not bad, pretty funny, I don’t appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here’s the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I’ve already set the bar really high. And they’re all worried about their jobs, you know. It’s kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, “Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You’re great. Love, Michael.”",Michael
25,"When I retire, I… don’t want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.",Michael

28,"Today at lunchtime we’re going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they’d put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, “This might be kinda fun.” And so I started messing around and… I’m sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So… you know, it’s really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.",Michael
29,"Classic beginner’s mistake, eating before a game.",Michael
30,"Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. Dwight, I was open. All right, let’s go.",Michael

32,What is wrong with me today?!,Michael
33,"Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don’t know… I might just be a basketball machine. What’s Dunder Mifflin? I’ve never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um… well, that’s probably gonna happen, actually.",Michael
34,"Football is like rock and roll, it’s just bam-bam-boo… And basketball is like jazz, you know? You’re kind of… Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It’s all downbeat, it’s in the pocket, it’s like… Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah…",Michael
35,"Shoot, shoot it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is… You all right Jim? Suck it up.",Michael
36,"Watch the long passes, you guys!",Michael
37,The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don’t win. But we did because we were ahead.,Michael
38,"Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it’s taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer. Answer over to The Question. The Answer, whew, three points. The Question, whew, whew, six points. Nothing but net. Question, who’s the best player in the league? Answer, The Question. Or the Drunkmeister.",Michael
39,"Birdie. He’s not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is… if you knew jazz, you’d know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is.",Michael

41,"I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.",Michael
42,"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It’s a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It’s not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!",Michael
43,"I think in order to be a ladies man, it’s imperative that people don’t know you’re a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don’t know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe they’re right? I don’t know.",Michael
44,"Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of ’em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I’d pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.",Michael
45,"T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it’s just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say “Don’t go there” but that’s… lame.",Michael
46,To Oscar Martinez it’s the “Show Me the Money” award! Yeah!,Michael
47,"This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson’s classic characters. Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. “Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.” Here’s the problem. There’s no open bar because of Jan and it’s the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It’ll be fine, I just…wish people were going to be drunk.",Michael
48,"“The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I’m psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You’re just a name and number and no one even says hello.” Card!",Michael

55,"Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So…",Michael
56,Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he’s really not a part of our family. Also he’s divorced so he’s really not a part of his family.,Michael
57,"A guy goes to a five dollar… lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says “Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?” This is what’s at stake.",Michael
58,"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don’t come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn’t arrest a guy who’s just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",Michael
59,"I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can’t be too careful about what you say. Mo’ money, mo’ problems.",Michael
60,"Times have changed a little. And even though we’re still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can’t take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.",Michael
61,"There’s a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It’s just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you’ve no place to go but down.",Michael
62,"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.",Michael

64,Hey!,Michael
65,"Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I’ve heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.",Michael
66,"When I was Ryan’s age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe… lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.",Michael
67,"I did not go to business school. You know who else didn’t go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So… so it’s not the same thing. At all.",Michael
68,"Hey! I know what’ll impress everybody, I’ll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.",Michael
69,"Okay. Rule five – safety first, i.e. don’t burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.",Michael
70,Oh… look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.,Michael
71,I’ll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.,Michael
72,It’s not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.,Michael

74,"Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?",Michael
75,"I love Halloween. You know, it’s just, it’s just fun. Every year, it’s just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson’s boob. It was topical. People got a… a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.",Michael
76,"All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. Wow, that’s a fast elevator.",Michael
77,"I’m friends with everybody in this office. We’re all best friends – I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren’t dentist appointments. And that’s when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.",Michael
78,"You talkin’ to me? You talkin’ to me? “Raging Bull.” Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work… Oh, oh check this out. Come here. There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This’ll be hilarious. Oh, we’re playing phone tag.",Michael
79,"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.",Michael
80,"God, you look like such an idiot.",Michael

I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So.",Michael
85,"I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question: do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don’t know.

I didn’t slip you something!",Michael
86,"Pam, could I see you in my office?",Michael
87,"My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we’ll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn’t want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn’t want it, we both didn’t want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something’s mutual, it never is. But this was mutual.",Michael
88,"Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn.",Michael
89,"I’m a little confused. ‘Cause first it’s all like kissy-kissy. And then it’s like all regret. Because “Oh, I regret that.” But, “Wait, I’m still gonna call you.” But, but, “We’re just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don’t do your job.” But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business.",Michael
90,Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn’t matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed; I’m good. I can go home now.,Michael
91,"“I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.” Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don’t understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?",Michael
92,"Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that’s right, yes. Um… I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I’m just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?",Michael
93,"Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was… He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don’t know how she dealt with that as long as she did.",Michael
94,"What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that’s me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.",Michael
95,The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.,Michael
96,"There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it— And I am not going to tell them that I’ll be reading their e-mails.",Michael
97,"Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim’s tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be… . No.",Michael
98,"There’s always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature’s rule. It’s intimidation mostly, it’s the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler.",Michael
99,"Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life? Somebody has a gun. That’s why I always start with a gun, because you can’t top it, you just can’t.",Michael
100,"Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv. The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says “Hey you’re funny, you’re the funniest guy I’ve ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.” And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.",Michael
101,"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G’s. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.",Michael
102,"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It’s like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, “Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.”",Michael
103,"So Phyllis is basically saying, “Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt’s worth.” I gave Ryan an iPod.",Michael
104,Everyone wants the iPod. It’s a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.,Michael
105,"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don’t know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.",Michael

107,Lampshade on head! It’s happening!,Michael

What’s better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It’s really the greatest day of all time.",Michael
109,Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela’s kind of… Angela’s little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.,Michael
110,"Dwight is… Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.",Michael
111,"See, that’s what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, “Man, I wish I got that.” I mean, that’s just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don’t know, it’s just… I don’t know, just makes you kind of feel good.",Michael

113,"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and… it wasn’t the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I’ve incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.",Michael
114,"Leader… ship. The word “ship” is hidden inside the word “leadership,” as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we’re all in the same boat. Teamwork!",Michael
115,"A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.",Michael
116,"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It’s nebulose.",Michael
117,"Hey, look! I’m king of the world!",Michael
118,Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that’s always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.,Michael
119,"I’m in the brig. See? The boat’s not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was… if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",Michael
120,Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I’m old.,Michael
121,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don’t have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it’s good for me. It’s the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot… that’s it. I don’t see what’s so hard to believe about that.",Michael
122,"No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I’m not gonna call Jan. She’d just worry… drive down here and make a big thing… Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?",Michael

125,"Yeah, baby, I am feelin’ better. My body’s literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.",Michael
126,The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout “shotgun” when you’re within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That’s how the game’s played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.,Michael
127,"Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.",Michael
128,"Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?",Michael
129,"Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.",Michael
130,"Uhhh it’s ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don’t understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?",Michael
131,"People are always coming to me. “Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust.” No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a… Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call… More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don’t, I don’t want to live like that. I like it here. I don’t want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.",Michael
132,"I am a big Fear Factor fan. I’m a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um… I can’t stand it , I can’t stay in here another second. No!",Michael
133,"Ed Truck. Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, “Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work.” What a jerk. He’s… You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.",Michael
134,"When I was in training, many years ago… not so long ago… I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office . Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that",Michael
135,"Another time, Packer held this guy’s head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn’t hired.",Michael
136,"Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. It was hysterical.",Michael
137,"Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don’t know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn’t do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her.",Michael
138,You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.,Michael
139,This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them.,Michael
140,"Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don’t have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, “Uh… no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney.”",Michael
141,"It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don’t expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It’s ah… God, these people are so… these are good people. We have fun. We just have fun! Oh, I’m just so sorry that I threw the thing out.",Michael
142,"Women in the workplace… yeah, translation “I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.” Oh! Sorry. ‘Women of the workplace.’ About what? I don’t know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!",Michael

144,"Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let’s just clap.",Michael
145,"Oh, I think it’s going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven’t been there in months.",Michael
146,Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there’s someone down here who shouldn’t be. A little “Good Will Hunting” situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don’t see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.,Michael
147,Check this out! Look at that! Look at that bwup-bwa! Hello! How are… Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.,Michael

150,Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza?,Michael
151,Ahhh! Excellent.,Michael
152,Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.,Michael
153,"This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine’s Day. It’s New York. City of Love.",Michael
154,"Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.",Michael
155,"The meeting isn’t ’til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I’m gonna go get me a New York slice.",Michael
156,"Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you’re in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that’s pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.",Michael
157,"Everybody takes the subway in New York. It’s fast, it’s efficient, gets you there on time. It’s a way to Okay, there’s a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.",Michael
158,"This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it’s, that’s Tina Fey . That’s Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? OH, I’m sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn’t. So… Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.",Michael
159,"I would love to live in New York someday. It’s a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It’d be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. OK, umm, I think, that’s either the Hudson or the East, so we’re back, should be back this way. There’s a lotta pressure on me right now. It’s like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin’ Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it’s over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let’s do it.",Michael
160,"Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won’t. You know, not what this is about.",Michael
161,Oy vey… schmear.,Michael
162,"I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.",Michael
163,"I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman’s body? The brains. Because I don’t think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.",Michael
164,"Okay, here’s the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, “Oh there’s nothing between us and stop talking about it.” And “Border-line harassment when you call me at home.” But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine’s Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.",Michael
165,"Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just… I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you’re awesome! Here’s a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here’s a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.",Michael

169,"I’m very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. …And now the black guy from the ‘Police Academy’ movies. A robot. Michael Winslow, anyone?",Michael
170,"Dwight gave a great speech. That’s the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?",Michael
171,"Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.",Michael
172,"Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid’s environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I’m going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in “Raw,” and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in “Daddy Daycare.” both great movies, but, still.",Michael
173,"It’s not that children make me uncomfortable, it’s just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I’ve never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.",Michael
174,"Just compare last year’s order to this year’s. Uh-huh. Yeah, I’m looking at it right now. … Yes. We–yeah, they’re very–they’re different. Yeah, we can stick with last year’s, you’re just going to have to supplement it, somehow.",Michael
175,"Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool.",Michael
176,"Alright, nowwww… what kind… of pizza do you like?",Michael
177,"I don’t get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives… They’re adults, for God’s sake.",Michael
178,"Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And… I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.",Michael
179,"Didn’t do background checks of the warehouse guys. Well, I’m sure it’ll be fine.",Michael
180,"Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don’t know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a",Michael
181,"When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids… and… I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me… for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.",Michael
182,"When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn’t even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So…",Michael
183,"Yeah, I’ve been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you’re on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.",Michael
184,"Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would… be… chaos.",Michael
185,"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don’t know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I’m sure that it was clove cigarettes.

192,"“This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.” “Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman’s room.

197,"One, two.. Didn’t say three, did I?",Michael
198,"But, I’m sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can’t outrun your problems.",Michael
199,And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here’s the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.,Michael

201,"There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. “I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.” And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke.

203,"Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I’m not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?",Michael
204,"Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I’ve got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.",Michael
205,"Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn’t hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that’s really more than half the battle.",Michael
206,I would have never called him that if I knew. You don’t… You don’t call retarded people “retards”. It’s bad taste. You call your friends “retards” when they’re acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend.,Michael
207,"The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.",Michael
208,"Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay porn, straight porn, it’s all goooooood! I don’t particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually… it is quite beautiful.",Michael

210,"Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love… to other men.",Michael
211,"We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can’t lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love… anyway? Maybe it’s supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar… and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?",Michael

If I can get them depressed, then I’ll have done my job.",Michael
233,"Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that’s baloney, because grief isn’t wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.",Michael

267,"This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.",Michael
268,Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then … and then suddenly she’s not yo’ ho no mo’.,Michael

274,"Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don’t make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?",Michael

276,"Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That’s all I’m gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.",Michael
277,"I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.",Michael
278,"Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It’s called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That’s how I want every day to be.",Michael

285,It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that’s what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don’t want somebody sucking up to me because they think I’m going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.,Michael
286,"Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life.",Michael

You’re it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not?

I buy my suits the old fashioned way. I buy them from discount stores… or on eBay. And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier. And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin. And I did too. And I grabbed this suit. And a woman, sort of a, I don’t know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket. And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war. And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get. And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before. Um, anyway, she s… socked me, in the eye. And she got it, she got the suit.

Now I have got their attention. I… tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, “Hey! You ever seen a suicide?” And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see… the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note: They might think “Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.” But that’s… not why I’m doing this… Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner… Ta-freakin’-da!",Michael
326,"An office… is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That’s the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can’t say. But, yes.",Michael
327,"You know what’s funny? Robin Williams. When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what’s not funny?

340,"I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn’t even me. It’s so not fair that they want me to resign.",Michael
341,"In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can’t have fun if they don’t feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far.

342,"Let’s face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They’re caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But… for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.",Michael
343,"Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There’s a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. “Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?” You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.",Michael
344,"Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman. I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see. And, um, it’s uncomfortable. So maybe I do understand.",Michael
345,I got shotgun. Damn it.,Michael
346,Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!,Michael
347,"Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you. Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section. Just show off the twins a little bit.",Michael
348,Idiot.,Michael
349,"I learned a lot about women today. And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. Jan and I broke up. Why? Because she didn’t like one message I left on her voicemail? But that is her peariagative. I thought I understood women, but maybe, can’t believe I’m gonna say this, maybe, women don’t understand themselves.",Michael

352,What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It’s like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.,Michael

354,Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. Watch out for snakes!,Michael

370,"I am by far the most qualified person they’re interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They’re like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy… is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep.",Michael

I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he’s a sophomore at Queens College. He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so… free food, and the place always smells like curry. So, win/win.",Michael
372,This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um… Andy and Dwight are rockin’ the sales team. I feel very blessed.,Michael
373,"So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?",Michael
374,"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don’t know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I’ll hit somebody with my car. So sue me… No, don’t sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I’m trying to make.",Michael
375,Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it’s not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.,Michael
376,"Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I’m not superstitious, but… I’m… I am a little-stitious.",Michael
377,"Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus’ dad?",Michael
378,"A woman shouldn’t have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me.

But not very many people know that.",Michael

381,"Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I’m getting a stitch.",Michael
382,"I am not going to finish. I can’t beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.",Michael
383,"Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That’s why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I’m very, very proud of that.",Michael
384,Maybe she hit me. You ever think of that? She hit me? I don’t know whose fault it was. I wasn’t exactly looking at the road.,Michael

386,"Yeah, the, uh, the charity’s having some financial problems. What do I look like to you, Paul Newman? That’s actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face. And I make my own salad dressing. I mix Newman’s Ranch with Newman’s Italian.

And I love you.” His words.",Michael
391,"We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that’s who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.",Michael
392,Some days I am just on fire. What can I say?,Michael
393,"Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it’s birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP’s, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City’s finest, and I do not mean policemen…",Michael
394,"Well the invitation says VIP’s only. Is this how you treat your VIP’s, Ryan? We’re already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I’m going to throw up. I’m throwing up. You’re making me throw up, Ryan.",Michael
395,You know what this is like? I’ll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn’t let any of the Seniors go.,Michael
396,"This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn’t as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I’m not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.",Michael
397,"Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to? Not at all. Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this. Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into. What are you gonna do?",Michael
398,Steak! Where’s my steeaaak?,Michael
399,"Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I’m sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I’m going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.",Michael
400,"Use to have two cars, traded ’em in, now we’re down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.",Michael
401,"I’m sorry Mr. O’Brian, I didn’t mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won’t be that fast, but it will–– it will be that easy.",Michael
402,"Yes I forgot about Ryan’s presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.",Michael
403,"I’ve never done this before. I’ve never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history.",Michael
404,"I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.",Michael
405,"I’ve always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I’ve already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I’m a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That’s the life.",Michael
406,I… DECLARE… BANKRUPTCY!,Michael
407,"What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I’m getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.",Michael
408,I’ve been putting money into CDs for years. I bought music that I didn’t even like. No.,Michael
409,"We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so… it’s uh, not too shabby.",Michael
410,"All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn’t even talk yet.",Michael
411,"We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let’s get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I’d like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.",Michael
412,"Well, it’s been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!",Michael
413,"It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world. And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time , and bad news isn’t always what it seems. Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance. To score. Dunder Mifflin. Limitless paper in a paperless world.",Michael
414,"You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don’t know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.",Michael
415,"What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We’re like Animal House.",Michael
416,"We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free. Pam, I’m gonna need some help writing a want ad.",Michael
417,"Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden… is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.",Michael
418,"When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called “Survivorman.” And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.",Michael
419,Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.,Michael
420,"Day One. I’m in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I’ve brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It’s hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o’clock in the afternoon. It’s really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don’t hit my corroded artery here…",Michael
421,"There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .",Michael
422,I’m going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.,Michael
423,"See, this is a beautiful piece of material This could be used for all sorts of things.",Michael
424,Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.,Michael
425,"I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I’m loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn’t even matter.",Michael
426,"Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.",Michael
427,"I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn’t come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I’m startin’ to feel it a little bit. Ohh… It’s Creed’s birthday. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.",Michael
428,"Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I’ve made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.",Michael
429,"Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn’t want to have to struggle to survive. I don’t need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don’t need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don’t need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky.",Michael
430,"My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn’t come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm… And Jan definitely, if there was room.",Michael
431,What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I’m optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.,Michael
432,"I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.",Michael
433,What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they’re just hanging me out to dry.,Michael
434,"No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.",Michael
435,"Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids…drinking whiskey and rye, oh why’d you have to go off and die? Why’d you have to go off and die?",Michael
436,"Love. Marriage. Baby carriage. Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song. Jan and I had love. We did not have marriage. We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.",Michael
437,"All right, time’s up! Pencils down. Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward.",Michael
438,"So far, these are my leads. A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher. It’s a start.",Michael
439,"I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude… that, but the women I’m getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren’t nice, or that have great personalities, they just… They just lack a certain… Crawfordness.",Michael
440,Ryan’s assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.,Michael
441,Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.,Michael
442,"I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I’ve asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They’re just, it’s not… Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.",Michael
443,"Like I said, it’s not about the horniness, it’s about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don’t, I disagree, I say… let’s hear it for the boys.",Michael
444,"Today is a very special day for me. And it’s really not about me, it’s about my grandkids, it’s about my great grandkids… I can come back here when I’m 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, “That’s me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole…” I dunno, it’s a good feeling.",Michael
445,"I am good person, and sometimes, good people don’t get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. Hey, I don’t get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, “I don’t respect you!” Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don’t get no respect? Airplane food. Why don’t they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don’t get no respect, some–take her, please, for example. If you don’t get no respect, you might be redneck. Respect is niiice. Borat. What’s the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don’t get no respect!",Michael
446,"I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time. But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk. I… jerks don’t deserve to be on pedestals. Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are. Big marble… jerk stand.",Michael
447,"Today I’m heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.",Michael
448,"Yeah, I’m trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being “lured” these days. Thank you Dateline!",Michael
449,"All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.",Michael
450,Hey! Game over.,Michael
451,"Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she’s hot! And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He’s the most… important thing in my life right now.",Michael
452,"Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.",Michael
453,"Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good.",Michael
454,"Well, kids today have a very short attention span. They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily. And today they’re being distracted by the other booths.",Michael
455,"Today is Toby Flenderson’s last day. I couldn’t sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy… There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.",Michael
456,"Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year… uh, as Nana starts to… but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn’t know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. “Michael, buy a motorcycle.” So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.",Michael
457,"Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she’s just an awesome woman from this planet.",Michael
458,"I’ll let you in on a little secret: I’ve been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin’ for a bruisin’ for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin’.",Michael
459,Oh my God. Ryan… Oh my God.,Michael
460,"Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I’m pretty sure she’s baked on a professional level.",Michael
461,"Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what… wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn’t believe in showing affection, so… sometimes I don’t know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh… I like it!",Michael
462,"Goodbye Toby, it’s been nice. Hope you find your paradise…",Michael
463,"Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby’s goin’ away! See ya! He’s outta here! See ya! He’s outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!",Michael
464,"My whole life, I have known two things: I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.",Michael
465,"Hi, Jan, it’s Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there’s any details you need to fill me in on, like… what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I… will see you tomorrow morning. I am going to be… kind of a daddy.",Michael
466,"This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.",Michael
467,"Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who’s your daddy? You don’t know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don’t. Come on. Let’s go in.",Michael
468,What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went — I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.,Michael
469,"Oh, Holly doesn’t need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.",Michael
470,"Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him.",Michael
471,It’s my sumo suit. I just didn’t inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.,Michael
472,I can’t wait to be a father. I’m going to smother that baby.,Michael
473,“Why are you helping her? You’re not even dating.” She’s my friend… and… ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship… without her even knowing. Uh…,Michael
474,I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don’t want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers.,Michael
475,"How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, “I told you so.” Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it’s a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? … Probably the funny way.",Michael
476,It is going to be the happiest day of my life.,Michael
477,"It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It’s like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is… it’s so bizarre and unnatural, but… it, it happens.",Michael
478,"I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it’s because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably – it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.",Michael
479,"I didn’t feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.",Michael
480,"In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where… you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don’t know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I’ll know for sure.",Michael
481,Probably get soup or something light.,Michael
482,So much for sex without consequences.,Michael
483,"We’re gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?",Michael
484,"To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I’m calling it crime-aid. It’s like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.",Michael
485,"Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You’re auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!",Michael
486,"Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It’s sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of…whether or not I had them-",Michael
487,"When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.",Michael
488,"Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I’m gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.",Michael
489,"Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor’s List. “Schindler’s List” parody. … That’s not appropriate, no.",Michael
490,"Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of….carrots. And, so he’s like “What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.”",Michael
491,"I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.",Michael
492,"My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery…",Michael
493,"A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered.",Michael
494,"Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it’s better to die with people you like… like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie… than to know that there’s somebody out there that you love that you’re not with.",Michael
495,"Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. ‘Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it’s because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off… right to his face… over the hone. That’s respect.",Michael
496,"I learned a while back that if I don’t text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.",Michael
497,"I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil… snail. I feel like I’m dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.",Michael
498,"I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.",Michael
499,"No, I don’t-this doesn’t change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.",Michael
500,"What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, you should know that some people think it’s cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.",Michael
501,"Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn’t left India.",Michael
502,"An intervention. It’s sort of hard to describe, but really its– it’s a coming together… it’s a surprise party for people who are– who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop.",Michael
503,"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That’s my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I’m not going to wish that on her. I– a watch would be nice.",Michael
504,As it turns out you can’t just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um… I think I can do it. I did it with Jan.,Michael
505,"Today’s a big day. My presence has been requested by Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I’ll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so… probably bad.",Michael
506,"Sometimes I’ll start a sentence, and I don’t even know where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.",Michael
507,"This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it’s cooler.",Michael
508,"Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here’s an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. Ahh!",Michael
509,"In nature, there is something called a food chain; it’s where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.",Michael
510,"Nobody should have to go to work thinking, “Oh, this is the place that I might die today.” That’s what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to… An office is a place where dreams come true.",Michael
511,"We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his… when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can’t get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.",Michael
512,Ohmmm… Ohmmm… Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. Ohmmm my God if you’re wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm… ohmmm…,Michael
513,My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. That one makes me think… of death. It’s kinda nice…,Michael
514,So… it wasn’t Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you’re the killer… it’s uh… great twist. Great twist.,Michael
515,I can already feel people’s stress starting to melt. I think they’re very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.,Michael
516,"NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY.",Michael
517,Caw… caw… caw caw… caw…,Michael
518,"You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don’t matter to him, because we’re just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. I’m okay. No, I’m not.",Michael
519,"They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should… better hold onto them pills, just in case.",Michael
520,"I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.",Michael
521,"I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.",Michael

525,"Just about everyone in this office is single right now. Including me. And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain. Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine’s Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.",Michael
526,"These people need love and I am going to get it for them Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else. I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say “I’m in love I was hit by cupid’s sparrow.” Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.",Michael
527,"It’s going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that’s what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so it’s not too late.",Michael
528,"Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I’ve even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what, sometimes it’s not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it’s about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There’s a lot of princesses out there. You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.",Michael
529,"The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It’s probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.",Michael
530,My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody’s golden ticket idea. That…,Michael

533,You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said ‘Yes’ to that either.,Michael
534,"People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana’s investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I’m sure that’s what she would have wanted. Does want.",Michael
535,"You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There’s gotta be some sort of secret office that you have… lurkin’ around… some awesome, free, keep it off the books… Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.",Michael
536,"I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That’s what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don’t think a woman can be a man? Well, then that’s your stereotype, not mine.",Michael
537,"I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!",Michael
538,"I don’t know I think we’ve done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I’ve updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers.

540,"They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?",Michael
541,"Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That’ll show ’em.",Michael
542,"Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don’t have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what’s important.",Michael
543,"I color code all my info. I wrote “gay son” in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means “Orange you glad you didn’t bring it up?” Most colors mean “Don’t say it.”",Michael
544,"I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn’t feel as important though. That’s just how the world works, I guess.",Michael

550,There are certain defining moments in a person’s life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don’t even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it.,Michael
551,"When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.",Michael

555,"Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate – it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.",Michael

558,"Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster’s People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don’t know. It’s like Dave died or something.",Michael

560,I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.,Michael
561,It’s better than I imagined it!,Michael
562,My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would….fall down. But then…he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He…stopped going out at night.

565,"I didn’t find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other.

567,"I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody’s attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.",Michael
568,"How do you un-tell something? You can’t. You can’t put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that’s been said is untrue, including “Stanley is having an affair.” It’s like the end of Spartacus. I’ve seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don’t know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.",Michael
569,"Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So… you can’t stop love, I guess and quite frankly, I don’t think you should ever try.",Michael

617,Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.,Michael

627,"I have been saying the word “manager” a lot, so whenever Jo thinks “manager” she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can’t even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.",Michael
628,"Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.",Michael
629,"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",Michael
630,That kid’s going to have a lot of hair.,Michael

638,"Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it’s kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.",Michael

642,"Hi, I’m date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?",Michael
643,"I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.",Michael

648,"It’s subtle. That’s how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn’t know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she’s turned on.",Michael
649,"What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that’s not… the point.",Michael
650,You know what? It doesn’t matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. I did do it!,Michael
651,"Ooh! Things with Donna are so… oh-ho-ho! They’re going great. I, uh… we’re just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and… orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I’m actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",Michael

653,"Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. But I figured I’d rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. The second time… I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time… I did it out of spite.",Michael
654,"I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband… or you took a random poll, yeah, it’s wrong.",Michael
655,I have got big balls.,Michael
656,"How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I’m a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. At the end of the day, we have to do what’s right. And it was either living with myself or… being happy. And I picked… the… former.",Michael
657,"Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I’m like, what? All right. So I do it. It’s on TV last night. And it’s in the paper today. And it’s online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It’s like, come on, people, enough.",Michael
658,"Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It’s not even that interesting a baby otter, it can’t even stand up. It’s trying to stand up… there it goes.",Michael
659,"I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he’s probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don’t know what is.",Michael

662,"We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?",Michael
663,"I suppose summer had to end sometime. It’s sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw ‘Inception.’ Or at least I dreamt I did.",Michael
664,"And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.",Michael
665,"Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14.

666,"Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he’ll slow down, and I’ll push him again. That’s the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It’s all about give and take, but mostly it’s about pushing each other.",Michael
667,"Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn’t. These things seldom work out. I don’t know how Ringling Brothers do it.

1160,Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check… on that later today. This is my grandmother’s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother’s buttock bullet ring.,Dwight
1161,The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.,Dwight
1162,"My job is to speak to clients on the phone about… uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And… I’m boring myself just talking about this.",Jim
1163,"If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam’s favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.",Jim
1164,Do I think I’ll be invited to the wedding?,Jim
1165,"This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I’m not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I’m pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I’m getting cocky. Right?",Jim
1166,"Mr. Decker, we didn’t lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your… what’s that? No, we didn’t close last time. I just need your… Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That’s actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don’t blame you.",Jim
1167,Uh… Not a bad day.,Jim
1168,"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.",Jim
1169,"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I’d have to throw myself in front of a train.",Jim
1170,"At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.",Jim
1171,"And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says “No, Jim, here’s a way.”",Jim
1172,That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.,Jim
1173,"Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set… and that was three years ago.",Jim
1174,"Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I’m, yeah, I’m looking forward to playing. You know, I think I’m gonna impress a few people in here.",Jim
1175,"Pam and I are good buddies. I’m sort of Pam’s go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh… Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.",Jim
1176,What a great year for the Dundies.,Jim
1177,"The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.",Jim
1178,"Hey, um… what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? This guy!",Jim
1179,"I’m in an office relationship. It’s special. Um… she’s nice. She’s shy. She’s actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a… . I told you that you’d be on camera. I’m sorry, she’s European. No, I told you that you’d be on camera. Stop it.",Jim
1180,So that’s what this sound is all day.,Jim
1181,Let the games begin.,Jim
1182,"Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.",Jim
1183,Okay. Thought people read more books.,Jim
1184,"Dwight is… special. But, I don’t believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig’s List. We’re really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska… or India.",Jim
1185,"Um… Whoa. Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I’m gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.",Jim
1186,"That’s just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we’re friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I’m gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn’t blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it’s double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.",Jim
1187,"Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight… Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I’m coming, fight…",Jim
1188,"So this possible client they’re talking about, actually a big deal. It’s Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. Years.",Jim
1189,"I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting.",Jim
1190,"I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I’m not a complainer.",Jim
1191,"Ok, we didn’t dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it’s not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?",Jim
1192,Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it’s Friday. And that’s what I’ll be working on this afternoon.,Jim
1193,"It’s true. I’m having a party. I’ve got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn’t invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it’s nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn’t be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I’m pretty sure he thinks that I’m making Dwight up. He is very real.",Jim
1194,"So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I’m also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. This would take a little too long to explain, so I won’t. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.",Jim
1195,"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number and then threw it in a bag.",Jim
1196,"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it’s a little too much to handle.",Jim
1197,"Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he’s king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.",Jim
1198,You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.,Jim
1199,"So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.",Jim
1200,I want to clamp Michael’s face in a George Foreman grill.,Jim
1201,Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world’s worst confidant.,Jim
1202,Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I don’t. Riveting.,Jim
1203,"Pam’s on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it’ll be nice to see her. It’ll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy. Uh… June. Summer. So, that’ll be nice. And that’s that.",Jim
1204,What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting.,Jim
1205,"So I broke up with Katy and haven’t been dating anybody else, so this year I don’t have to worry about Valentine’s Day. It’s gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We’re gonna play some cards and I’ll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they’re idiots. It’s gonna be great.",Jim
1206,"Nah that’s alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That’s fine. No, I didn’t even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.",Jim
1207,"Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so… I guess there really is someone for everybody.",Jim
1208,"Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so…",Jim
1209,I’m going to take a trip. I’m going to get out of town for a while… and go someplace… not here.,Jim
1210,Where do I want to go? Um… that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um…,Jim
1211,"Ok, I didn’t actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history’s famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini.",Jim
1212,"“A7557962.” Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.",Jim
1213,"So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight",Jim
1214,Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don’t get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?,Jim
1215,"Yeah, I mean it’s inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I’m fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.",Jim
1216,Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,Jim
1217,"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just… took ’em all out.",Jim
1218,"Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don’t sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.",Jim
1219,"Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that’s how I spent my entire day that day.",Jim
1220,"Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know… I have no future here.",Jim
1221,I will raise. Thanks.,Jim
1222,"It’s the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.",Jim
1223,"I can’t say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.",Jim
1224,Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that’s pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can’t beat that view… right?,Jim
1225,"I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. …I don’t think any of them actually know my real name.",Jim
1226,What’s gay-dar?,Jim
1227,I miss that.,Jim
1228,"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.",Jim
1229,"At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they’re all really into it. I’m told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn’t play many video games in Scranton. Instead we’d do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it… Pretendenitus.",Jim
1230,Things are a little bit… different here in Stamford. It’s not bad.,Jim
1231,"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.",Jim
1232,Sorry.,Jim
1233,"I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape… helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.",Jim
1234,"Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation… which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.",Jim
1235,"I don’t have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight’s stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. “Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.”",Jim
1236,"I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it’s going to be weird that it’s all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.",Jim
1237,"Where do I stand with Pam? Um… no idea. I mean, we’re friends. Always have been friends. Um… .that is where we stand.",Jim
1238,It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. ‘The Scranton Witch Project’.,Jim
1239,"Yes. I have started to see Karen. It’s very new, and… not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or… I dunno. Just, not yet.",Jim
1240,"I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates…",Jim
1241,"It’s a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael’s a bold guy. Is bold the right word?",Jim
1242,"I feel like there’s a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then … what am I doing?",Jim
1243,"Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that’s what you want, right?",Jim
1244,"Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm… OK, it’s pretty much the same thing.",Jim
1245,"Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.",Jim
1246,"I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.",Jim
1247,"Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So…",Jim
1248,"Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.",Jim
1249,"Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings. Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.",Jim
1250,"In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I’ve been conducting a similar experiment.",Jim
1251,"Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then… No, it’s totally hypothetical.",Jim
1252,Here’s a ‘not hypothetical’. I’m really happy I’m with Karen.,Jim
1253,"Pam’s with Roy. I’m with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin’ on.",Jim
1254,"Why don’t I wanna go? Didn’t expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don’t know any of these people. It’s an obligation. I don’t like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?",Jim
1255,"I guess… all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.",Jim
1256,"It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven.",Jim
1257,"I… will never say a word. And now, we are even.",Jim
1258,"Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that’s a grand total of… eleven dollars.",Jim
1259,"Lord, beer me strength.",Jim
1260,That is pretty cool.,Jim
1261,That’s pretty cool.,Jim
1262,"Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man’s eyes… ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.",Jim
1263,"Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.",Jim
1264,"I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh… it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn’t mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh… I’m single now and looking, so if you know anybody.",Jim
1265,One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.,Jim
1266,"Oh, I’m sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?",Jim
1267,"Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I’m not really sure what’s wrong with it.",Jim
1268,And… that is why we waited so long to tell people.,Jim
1269,"There’s this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it’s heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.",Jim
1270,"Yep, I’m very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I’m in love with Italian food.",Jim
1271,"I think it’s great that the company’s making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or… And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.",Jim
1272,"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?",Jim
1273,"Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director’s cut. Hope you like it.",Jim
1274,"Michael is on a mission to prove that he’s creative. Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I’ve ever known. Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.",Jim
1275,"So the deal was, Dwight doesn’t blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache.",Jim
1276,"When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.",Jim
1277,And I am always busy.,Jim
1278,"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.",Jim
1279,"And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to “Happy Birthday.” And he’s a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.",Jim
1280,"So… I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.",Jim
1281,"Toby’s great. He’s great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. I don’t see the harm in that. Well, it’s a cake Toby, so, c’mon.",Jim
1282,"Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.",Jim
1283,"Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we’ve been able to get out of it. But I’ve got to give him credit, he got me. Because I’m starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.",Jim
1284,Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it’s called ‘Let’s see how uncomfortable we can make our guests’ and they’re both winning. So I’m going to make a run for it.,Jim
1285,I am not kidding. Got it a week after we started dating.,Jim
1286,"You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn’t have to come in at all tomorrow.",Jim
1287,"So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas… the one time a year they hear one.",Jim
1288,"Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I’d like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I’ve never done before. Try.",Jim
1289,So I guess I’ll just… work on my short game.,Jim
1290,"You know it’s a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don’t quit either, and I’d call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after …fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I’m feeling pretty good.",Jim
1291,"If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino’s. And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler. And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.",Jim
1292,"Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.",Jim
1293,"Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.",Jim
1294,I’m going to propose tonight. Holy crap!,Jim
1295,"Hey, Ryan, it’s Jim. Look man, I don’t know what’s gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don’t care, because you’re trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don’t think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you’re wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I’m not going anywhere.",Jim
1296,"I’ve always gotten along well with Toby. Uh, we’re friends. But I don’t think we’ll stay in touch necessarily. I think I’ll probably get updates on him from Pam.",Jim
1297,"Is Ryan gonna fire me? I don’t know. I know that I’ve done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and… am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago? Because in the three years that he’s been here, I think all he’s ever done is start a fire and grow a beard. And it’s not even a good beard.",Jim
1298,"Okay, what’s going on?",Jim
1299,"Why haven’t I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um — well, we didn’t want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam’s always said she doesn’t want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I’m not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here…",Jim
1300,"I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It’s because Holly is kind of a major dork.",Jim
1301,"I don’t really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.",Jim
1302,"When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.",Jim
1303,Some girl came into Pam’s room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I’m in here waiting it out.,Jim
1304,"Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch… actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider… coworkers.",Jim
1305,Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I’m convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven’t seen her in 10 days. How’s your summer?,Jim
1306,...,Jim
1307,"When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father… by telling us he was the father. But then we got this e-mail from Jan. “Hi, everyone! Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor. First, the great news – I am expecting. The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line . Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met. Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father. Best, Jan. P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.”",Jim
1308,"He has not stopped working for a second. At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven’t even started work. It’s exhausting, being this vigilant. I’ll probably have to go home early today.",Jim
1309,"Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through delusion.",Jim
1310,I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should.,Jim
1311,No. you know what? No. Because… I’m not that guy. And we are not that couple.,Jim
1312,"I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.",Jim
1313,...,Jim
1314,"Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I’m just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It’s just… different styles.",Jim
1315,Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.,Jim
1316,"Today’s a big day. Today’s the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it’s my parent’s house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It’s got shag carpets. I mean you can’t blame my parents it was the 70’s. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. She’s gonna love it. Right?",Jim
1317,"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don’t have to agree on everything.",Jim
1318,Whew.,Jim
1319,"Andy still doesn’t know that Angela’s having an affair with Dwight. And it’s been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he’ll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it’s just… awkward.",Jim
1320,"So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day… leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.",Jim
1321,"I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. Oh he’ll be fine. I made it up there.",Jim
1322,What’s going on?,Jim
1323,"Uh, no one really knows, but Pam’s parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.",Jim
1324,"Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so… it was her parents or my parents…",Jim
1325,I forgot if there was an “e” between the “l” and the “y.” I still don’t know.,Jim
1326,"About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.",Jim
1327,Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.,Jim
1328,"I’ve never been a kiss up. I – it’s just not how I operate. I mean, I’ve always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.",Jim
1329,"Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.",Jim
1330,"The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles’ office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says “You wanted me” enough, he will in fact want her. It’s not the worse plan she’s ever had.",Jim
1331,What the hell’s a rundown?,Jim
1332,Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.,Jim
1333,"I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.",Jim
1334,...,Jim
1335,I’m just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He’s winning. I feel like I’m describing a dream I had.,Jim
1336,We should probably stop by. It’d mean a lot to him.,Jim
1337,"Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we’re all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about… ten minutes.",Jim
1338,"Oh, Dwight, we’re so close! Just buy us a few more minutes… Well, they just called me in for an update, so I’ll call you right back… Okay… Okay, great. Hey, Dwight, uh… send in the subs! Ohh!",Jim
1339,"I didn’t tell Michael because I thought he’d try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.",Jim
1340,I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.,Jim
1341,"I’ve been studying Michael for years, and I’ve condensed what I’ve learned into this chart– How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.",Jim
1342,"Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It’s really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.",Jim
1343,I may have told some people that. I’m nervous. I’m about to get married.,Jim
1344,"I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we’d need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her.",Jim
1345,...,Jim
1346,"We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.",Jim
1347,"Sure. Michael’s a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That’s what a teacher is, right?",Jim
1348,He’s trying to micro-co-manage me… or co-micro… manage… me.,Jim
1349,"Truthfully, it wasn’t the way he fell in. It was… how long it took him to get out.",Jim
1350,"I should’ve grabbed you. I’m sorry. Look, I thought I could’ve done today’s sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.",Jim
1351,"Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate… because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.",Jim
1352,"Sure I’m a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good.",Jim
1353,"Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.",Jim
1354,"I think today was a good day to have two managers. ‘Cause if you’re a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it’s not because they’re crazy. It’s because they’re doing it for the kids. And I get that now.",Jim
1355,"Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that – get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6:00.",Jim
1356,"Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.",Jim
1357,The next year he really stepped things up.,Jim
1358,A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.,Jim
1359,Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing… I can’t remember.,Jim
1360,I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.,Jim
1361,"So you’ve been shown a nonsensical video. You’re probably wondering, “What’s going on?” Well, you’re not alone.",Jim
1362,"I don’t think I’m gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they’re not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I’m definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.",Jim
1363,"So, the plan was seven minutes. But we’re calling an audible, because that’s her call. Because she’s the quarterback. I’m just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.",Jim
1364,"I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she’s gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I’m crazy. But I’m not crazy, she’s crazy. I’m not crazy, she’s crazy. Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes.",Jim
1365,I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.,Jim
1366,"No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.",Jim
1367,I am not surprised that Dwight’s using my baby to steal my desk. I’m a little surprised that it’s working.,Jim
1368,Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies – that’s just unfair.,Jim
1369,"I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I – and I love her. I also love her, very much.",Jim
1370,"What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.",Jim
1371,It’s like The Hurt Locker!,Jim
1372,Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and…that’s it. That’s really all we were looking for.,Jim
1373,"Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn’t seem to realize that it wasn’t his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won’t notice?",Jim
1374,"I’ve never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number …no.",Jim
1375,Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.,Jim
1376,"To be honest, I still can’t believe he didn’t call her back. Who doesn’t call a dork like that back?",Jim
1377,"Okay. Okay. There’s my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What’s that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!",Jim
1378,"Okay, “A,” Halbert. And, “B,” I think a more appropriate statement would be, “The ‘Halberts’ are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.”",Jim
1379,"Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson’s funeral. Things that if you didn’t see them live, you wouldn’t really care that you didn’t see them at all.",Jim
1380,"All right, Thank you, I will–I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. Whoo!",Jim
1381,"I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let’s be honest–if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob… I can pretty much sell anything.",Jim
1382,"Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I’ve cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So… what now?",Jim
1383,"Around here, Oscar is known as ‘actually’ because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.",Jim
1384,...,Jim
1385,"Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing ’em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, then… “How ’bout icing it? lol. Dwight.”",Jim
1386,I just want it to stop.,Jim
1387,"Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn’t make that.",Jim
1388,I mean…,Jim
1389,I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don’t think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.,Jim
1390,I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.,Jim
1391,"I’m sorry, that just wasn’t interesting to me.",Jim
1392,So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?,Jim
1393,"There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.",Jim
1394,So this is my life. Until I win the lottery . Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.,Jim
1395,Now what?,Jim
1396,"So as it turns out, unless you’re a young child or a prison inmate, you don’t need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that – people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.",Jim
1397,"If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, “Well that’s pretty premature to think,” but I always say, it’s better to be pre-pre-preprepared.",Jim
1398,He never called a meeting.,Jim
1399,"We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch’s new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone’s bound to be, right? And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I’m not too worried. But I’m really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. Did you know that Gabe’s last name was Lewis? I had no idea.",Jim
1400,"He creeps me out. But, I think he might be a genius.",Jim
1401,"The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California… for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.  He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO… CEO… her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don’t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.   And he chose…",Jim
1402,"The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he’s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it’s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It’s strange.",Jim
1403,"There’s this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there’s an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a… phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it’ll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.",Jim
1404,I’m actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. I’ve only sold one copy.,Jim
1405,"Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.",Jim
1406,Chapter 4 – One of the host’s most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.,Jim
1407,"Chapter 9 – The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.",Jim
1408,"I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.",Jim
1409,No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.,Jim
1410,"I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80’s movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don’t do that, I think I’ll be alright.",Jim
1411,"No, I’m not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I’m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It’s true, but it doesn’t help anybody.",Jim
1412,"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I’m in the clear. If that wasn’t for the matchmaker test, then… Cathy, he’s a really nice guy.",Jim
1413,"No, I’m not worried. Because this lie isn’t for me, it’s for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back… yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven’t had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.",Jim
1414,"I’m excited, I’ve actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I’m older now, I can outrun a zombie.",Jim
1415,"No, I don’t think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it’s doing.",Jim
1416,"Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open… uh, okay.",Jim
1417,This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I’m not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley’s tie is really the story of the day…,Jim
1418,I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. …Might not have been the best idea.,Jim
1419,Ah… I’m gonna s-,Jim
1420,"Dwight really wants my bonus. He’s trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can’t drink at this thing….I get really pranky when I drink.",Jim
1421,"Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card…you want the number? Oh it’s uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.",Jim
1422,"So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife…from me.",Jim
1423,"Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something……C’mon, Jim. I got nothin’.",Jim
1424,"It’s always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she’s out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I’ve found out what he likes. And it’s really weird.",Jim
1425,"You’re looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don’t mean to brag, but New Year’s Eve, I was home by nine.",Jim
1426,"I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn’t think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.",Jim
1427,I never considered that my week off would make everyone else’s job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.,Jim
1428,You want a giraffe?,Jim
1429,"I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that’s not happening, I’m not averse to just buying them all off.",Jim
1430,"I’ve spent so much of my life telling myself “Please, don’t end up like Stanley,” and now I’m wondering if I even have what it takes.",Jim
1431,"This is the last time I’ll ever see Dwight. It’s a weird feeling, it’s, um, what’s the word? It’s not, it’s not bittersweet. It’s uh… sweet. Yeah.",Jim
1432,"Well, I tried. You saw it, so, it’s on the record. I have a plane to catch.",Jim
1433,What is going on? And where’s Andy? And what is going on?,Jim
1434,"I think it’s a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It’s not a name.",Jim
1435,"I’m sorry, we’re taking work time to move someone’s personal belongings into their new apartment.",Jim
1436,Why is she here?,Jim
1437,"Phyllis says the same twelve clichés every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.",Jim
1438,"Uh, Ryan can never know.",Jim
1439,"Last week, I may have gone too far. I’ll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And… you can fill in the rest.",Jim
1440,Now he’s trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it’s fair to be cautious.,Jim
1441,"No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith’s face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.",Jim
1442,I have nothing in common with Plop.,Jim
1443,"Oh, come on, Pete! God, that’s just sad. If he doesn’t watch himself, he’s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.",Jim
1444,"Hey, man. It’s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don’t. I’m in. Yeah, yep, I’m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. Yeah!",Jim
1445,"I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn’t know. Um… actually I did tell Pam and we decided ‘no’. But, then I decided ‘yes’ anyway. So, I’m thinking there’s another conversation coming. And, it’s hard to know when that will be.",Jim
1446,"Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what’d they say? That’s awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!",Jim
1447,It’s not even real yet. And I’m not gonna tell her ’til it’s real.,Jim
1448,"Pam always says I look like Nixon. That’s crazy, right? I mean there’s nothing there. True— Oh no.",Jim
1449,I don’t know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.,Jim
1450,"Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly…the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! Gotta go through me first.",Jim
1451,"I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I’m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I’ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels… wrong.",Jim
1452,"I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I’d get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.",Jim
1453,I bit my lip at lunch today.,Jim
1454,Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.,Jim
1455,"Whatever. It’s not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that’s gonna happen… You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That’s it, I’m going home!",Jim
1456,"I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam’s face because let’s be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.",Jim
1457,"Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that’s only gonna make things worse.",Jim
1458,"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we’re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I’m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So… problem solved. Thanks, guys.",Jim
1459,"No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I’m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.",Jim
1460,"Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that’s just ‘Roommates 101’.",Jim
1461,"I’m very excited to see Brian. Brian’s a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I’m sorry, but you know him. He’s a good guy.",Jim
1462,"If I didn’t do certain things without telling Pam, she’d be married to Roy.",Jim
1463,"Well, if Pam says she won’t go, then— we’re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.",Jim
1464,"Don’t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.",Jim
1465,"The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that’s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I’m not risking that again.",Jim
1466,"By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.",Jim
1467,Thank you.,Jim
1468,"Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he’s on to me. Um…",Pam
1469,Roy’s my fiance. We’ve been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we’re gonna get married in the spring.,Pam
1470,"It would’ve been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn’t have made any sense either.",Pam
1471,"Yeah, um, there’s good things about Michael. He uh, uh… Yeah, definitely. Um…",Pam
1472,This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn’t like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn’t smack her.,Pam
1473,"My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn’t make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I’m kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.",Pam
1474,"No, no, I know that the warranty’s expired, but isn’t it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn’t defective? OK, fine, three years.",Pam
1475,"It’s nice having Katy around. It’s another person for Michael to um, interact with.",Pam
1476,Jim is a great guy. He’s like a brother to me. We’re like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.,Pam
1477,"You know what they say about a car wreck, where it’s so awful you can’t look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.",Pam
1478,Michael has taped,Pam
1479,Can I get a drink?,Pam
1480,My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn’t have a cell phone… which is cool cause it’s kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she’ll walk in.,Pam
1481,Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.,Pam
1482,I love my Mom. Okay. That’s probably really the most obvious statement ever.,Pam
1483,He said what?,Pam
1484,"Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it’s up to me to revive him.",Pam
1485,"The thing about Jim, is when he’s excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.",Pam
1486,"Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they’re like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh… I don’t know! You know? They’re just… She calls him, and they… You know, I’m sorry. I feel like I’m talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?",Pam
1487,"I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just… good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.",Pam
1488,I’m guessing Angela’s the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.,Pam
1489,"Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh, yeah. Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.",Pam
1490,"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who’s getting a better job offer. Like, for real.",Pam
1491,"Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that’s today. I call it the Perfect Storm.",Pam
1492,"Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I’m not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that’s why he started casual Fridays.",Pam
1493,I’ll take those. Thanks.,Pam
1494,"Here’s what we think happened. Michael’s sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who’s causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn’t work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.",Pam
1495,"It’s performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don’t really know what to expect.",Pam
1496,It’s like squishing a spider under a book. It’s gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it’s really dead. Sooo… If you guys see anything… ?,Pam
1497,What? Ohhhh… Yes! Thank you!,Pam
1498,"Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn’t mean that they’re together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.",Pam
1499,"Yeah, I think I made the right choice.",Pam
1500,"Oh God no, Dwight isn’t my friend… Oh my God! Dwight’s kind of my friend!",Pam
1501,"Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.",Pam
1502,Somebody did something bad to Michael’s carpet. Maybe that’s all we need to know.,Pam
1503,"Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can’t see Michael’s head. It’s working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.",Pam
1504,"Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.",Pam
1505,"I’ll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is … okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would’ve happened, so thank you.",Pam
1506,"Hey, what’s that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.",Pam
1507,"Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I’m not messing this up, so I’ll see you tomorrow.",Pam
1508,"Calling from my cell phone. I don’t know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael’s carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk.",Pam
1509,Today’s a ‘women in the workplace’ thing. Jan’s coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about… um… I don’t really know what. But Michael’s not allowed in. She said that about five times.,Pam
1510,I don’t know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um… I mean we get along great. Fine. Um… I guess the person I have the most in common with is…,Pam
1511,Dreams are just that. They’re dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It’s nice but… um… I don’t know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.,Pam
1512,"It’s impractical. I’m not going to try to get a house like that. Um… they don’t even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I’m never going to… .",Pam
1513,"Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.",Pam
1514,Michael’s got a few tricks for Valentine’s Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he’s got a great line. “Me so thorny.”,Pam
1515,I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um… just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then… I just… I don’t want to offend… Angela… or someone.,Pam
1516,I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.,Pam
1517,"If I knew I had a week to live, I would… probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And… I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. …It would be a pretty busy week.",Pam
1518,Michael’s birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don’t know… It was a good day.,Pam
1519,Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.,Pam
1520,"What? Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. You look like you have something really important to say and you just can’t for some reason. Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything.",Pam
1521,"There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but … it’s my wedding. And I don’t want anyone there who has called me a hussy.",Pam
1522,I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I’ve been really nice to her… and I haven’t told anyone. And what the hell?!,Pam
1523,I’m pretty happy these days. I’m getting married soon and I’m getting along with everybody at work.,Pam
1524,Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.,Pam
1525,Sometimes I don’t put Michael through until he’s already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.,Pam
1526,"About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn’t know what to say. Yes, I know. Um, I don’t know, mom, he’s my best friend. Yeah, he’s great. Yeah, I think I am. I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim…",Pam
1527,"Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he’s making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I’d like to choose a different adjective.",Pam
1528,"Yeah, I didn’t go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can’t really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I’m, I’m doing well. I have my own apartment. I’m taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks.",Pam
1529,What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody’s personal business!,Pam
1530,"Yes, I have a date. He’s a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I’m kind of nervous. I haven’t been on a first date in nine years… probably shouldn’t broadcast that.",Pam
1531,"I went on a date. It wasn’t a love connection, um… I think when I like someone again, I’ll just kinda know.",Pam
1532,"Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it’s been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.",Pam
1533,"Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.",Pam
1534,"Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um… just get new clothes.",Pam
1535,"I have this little vacuum cleaner that’s broken. If Dwight doesn’t work out, maybe that could be manager.",Pam
1536,"Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I’m gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it’ll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren’t pajamas.",Pam
1537,"I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael’s been suspicious.",Pam
1538,Did I wake up this morning thinking I’d be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.,Pam
1539,"Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, “Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.”",Pam
1540,"It’s weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it’s like he’s five.",Pam
1541,Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It’s really not a big deal. To some people it is.,Pam
1542,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He’s, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.",Pam
1543,It’s like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.,Pam
1544,"Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan’s body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It’s an old bet, but a deal’s a deal.",Pam
1545,Very official.,Pam
1546,"I decided to come. Uh… I feel a little under-dressed… but at least I’m not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?",Pam
1547,"It’s a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, “Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.” So, maybe that’ll stop now.",Pam
1548,"Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There’s another annoying boss, another desk, I’d have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",Pam
1549,"Yes! I’m in a good mood today! I’m excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That’s always a thing that makes people happy… to have an old friend back.",Pam
1550,"The day’s going fine. It’s been a little chaotic but it’s fine. It’s great! A lot of distractions. But, it’s good.",Pam
1551,Wow. That was… wow.,Pam
1552,"I feel like I’ve been kinda cold to Karen and there’s no real reason for it. I mean it’s not like she’s ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn’t be cold to her.",Pam
1553,"No, I didn’t mind helping Jim with his problem. That’s what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.",Pam
1554,"Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I’m Jamaican-him-crazy. I don’t know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.",Pam
1555,Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.,Pam
1556,"Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory ’07. It’s actually a success compared to Disco Audit ’05.",Pam
1557,"Something’s up with Jim and Karen. Not that I’ve been eavesdropping. It’s not really any of my business, but I’ve gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim’s neck.",Pam
1558,"Phyllis… ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like ‘Wait, thought I called that off’.",Pam
1559,"Also, Pam and Roy.",Pam
1560,I’m really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. … Is that braggy? I don’t mean it to be braggy.,Pam
1561,"I have decided that I’m going to be more honest. I’m going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol’ Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don’t call me Pammy.",Pam
1562,"I really don’t want to talk about it. I don’t mean to be rude, but I just… I don’t want to comment on what happened. It",Pam
1563,It’s been a really rough couple of days… This helps a little.,Pam
1564,"I don’t know how the whole betting thing started, but it’s fun.",Pam
1565,Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman’s touch.,Pam
1566,Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.,Pam
1567,My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.,Pam
1568,"I don’t often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim’s… Whoo, I am… I am saying a lot of things.",Pam
1569,I’m kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don’t need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.,Pam
1570,"You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe’s already coming in handy. Coming!",Pam
1571,"It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand…",Pam
1572,"About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.",Pam
1573,"I have the most boring job in the office, so… why wouldn’t I have the most boring job on beach day?",Pam
1574,"Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh…",Pam
1575,"Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That’s Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We’re a regular Ocean’s Eleven.",Pam
1576,"After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he’s coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so thank you.",Pam
1577,"No, it’s fine. I’m sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around… that",Pam
1578,"I’m happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche… Maybe I’m being cliche. I don’t care. Cause I am what I am. That’s Popeye.",Pam
1579,"I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret… you reply, “Absolutely, I do.”",Pam
1580,I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here.,Pam
1581,"No, I don’t know what the future holds, but… I’m optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I… are just… too similar. Maybe one day I’ll find my own Karen. But— you— that is, a, um, you know, not— A man. A man version. But, uh, until then… I can hold my head up. … I’m not gay.",Pam
1582,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I’ll transfer you.",Pam
1583,Kelly made me realize something. She and I have… nothing in common. And I need more friends.,Pam
1584,Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It’s really nice to be good friends again.,Pam
1585,They say if you’re nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on… or a funny coat.,Pam
1586,"I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn’t see it? Did Jim say that I didn’t see it? I saw it!",Pam
1587,Dwight mercy killed Angela’s cat. It’s very complicated. It’s caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.,Pam
1588,"Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.",Pam
1589,"He’s a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn’t be surprised that he’s identified with her character.",Pam
1590,Mo Chuisle. He’s watching Million Dollar Baby… He’s gonna try to kill me.,Pam
1591,Oh my God. What century is this?,Pam
1592,"Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn’t do that to Dwight… or Angela… or Andy.",Pam
1593,"Man, Angela really had a hold on him. Angela.",Pam
1594,Dwight.,Pam
1595,Jim’s just really passionate about Italian food.,Pam
1596,"I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.",Pam
1597,"Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we’re always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It’s very exclusive.",Pam
1598,"I’m kidding around. We joke about that stuff all the time. I’m not really the jealous type, so, I don’t care if Jim sees Karen. I care a little.",Pam
1599,Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a “get to know you” weekend. Michael wasn’t invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.,Pam
1600,"Here’s the thing. When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.",Pam
1601,"I don’t care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for… at a dinner party.",Pam
1602,I know Jan didn’t poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn’t it be me? Michael’s former lover?,Pam
1603,One night…,Pam
1604,"Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn’t care, but he promised me his old one. It’s way better. It’s one of these. I really want it.",Pam
1605,"I’m setting Michael up with my land lady. She’s really sweet and… whatever, I just can’t take Michael like this.",Pam
1606,"There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, “What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?” He said, “If I’m dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.”",Pam
1607,"Um… yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend’s house and, I forgot my contact solution, so… I had to wear my backup glasses… Shut up.",Pam
1608,"What’s it like without my glasses? Um, well, here, I’ll show you. Unfocus your lens. A lot. I’m 20/400. You got it? Okay, I’m gonna spend the rest of the day like this. I can’t see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day. I can’t see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael… it’s great.",Pam
1609,"Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.",Pam
1610,"So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn’t have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn’t have to play basketball. Those were the days!",Pam
1611,"My old art room. Oh, maybe it’s still here! No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.",Pam
1612,"I wouldn’t go if things weren’t so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn’t go then either. So, the timing’s perfect… And that is the first time I’ve ever used the word “perfect” in here!",Pam
1613,"Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn’t he? No, he’s not… Is he?",Pam
1614,"I’m gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.",Pam
1615,"Don’t tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.",Pam
1616,"Oh look, they’re starting.",Pam
1617,"I don’t know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight…",Pam
1618,"Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. What up, 212?",Pam
1619,"New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city’s awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?",Pam
1620,"I’m not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We’re just… a little out of sync. You know, that’s all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick.",Pam
1621,"New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.",Pam
1622,"Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.",Pam
1623,"So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can’t even take off my hat, because then I’m Hitler.",Pam
1624,"I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they’re into the idea. They’re probably thinking, “That Pam Beasly, she’s the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She’s the best! The absolute best.”",Pam
1625,They came up with that idea really fast.,Pam
1626,Jim? Jim?,Pam
1627,Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.,Pam
1628,Right Dwight is loud.,Pam
1629,"Oh, come on! Do you see this? Disgusting.",Pam
1630,"So, I guess that’s how they’re gonna play this. It is on. It is so on.",Pam
1631,"Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I’ve had two engagement rings, and only one chair?",Pam
1632,"Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It’s actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.",Pam
1633,My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and… it kinda sucks. Jim’s been great. But I’m gonna need to buy my dad a robe.,Pam
1634,"Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.",Pam
1635,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?",Pam
1636,What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?,Pam
1637,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I’m sorry, Michael’s not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.",Pam
1638,"Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I’ll see ya then.",Pam
1639,When you’re a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.,Pam
1640,"I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn’t hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so…",Pam
1641,"Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.",Pam
1642,"So, detour. We’re now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don’t think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! I’ve been driving too long.",Pam
1643,"Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.",Pam
1644,"Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly’s boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! Cutting down the competition.",Pam
1645,Don’t look up. Don’t look up.,Pam
1646,"They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job. But I’d like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. Vending machine.",Pam
1647,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. No, I’m sorry he’s not back from the Civil Rights rally. I’ll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.",Pam
1648,"When Michael’s skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. ‘Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ‘ ‘An Obama fashion show. ‘ Whatever… that is. Or ‘trapped in an oil painting.’ I’m gonna save that one.",Pam
1649,He finally has a story everyone wants to hear… and he knows it.,Pam
1650,"During the course of business, a copier goes though something called ‘Normal wear and tear.’",Pam
1651,"Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn’t set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting.",Pam
1652,"I’m at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.",Pam
1653,"I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels…",Pam
1654,"I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I’m receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it’s cold in there. Cause it’s technically a closet.",Pam
1655,I’m just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that’s okay. The air smells so good. I don’t remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.,Pam
1656,I’m here. I’m a part of this now.,Pam
1657,We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says “Alleluia Church of Scranton.” in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.,Pam
1658,"When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don’t blame the child. He didn’t know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, “Drive, kid. I trust you.”",Pam
1659,"If you don’t take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.",Pam
1660,Maybe I played a little in junior high… and in high school… maybe a little in college… and went to volleyball camp most summers.,Pam
1661,"This is the last day of our summer interns. It’s been nice. We haven’t had interns for a while, ever since Michael’s Monica Lewinsky incident. He didn’t do anything sexual. He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.",Pam
1662,It’s clear why we were trying not to tell people. That’s clear now.,Pam
1663,"We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn’t be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls. Which is why we’re having it in Niagara Falls. Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.",Pam
1664,"It’s awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn’t Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?",Pam
1665,Is this what I’ve become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. oh look! “Mrs. Pam Halpert!” That’s the first time I’ve seen it in writing!,Pam
1666,The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.,Pam
1667,I don’t think I’m asking for too much. I guess it’s just the end of courtesy in the workplace.,Pam
1668,"Michael’s been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don’t know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he’s planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out.",Pam
1669,Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn’t even blow it.,Pam
1670,I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.,Pam
1671,Yup.,Pam
1672,Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!,Pam
1673,Yes! They’re the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.,Pam
1674,"It might seem crazy, but since there’s no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin’s highest ranking employee. So, that’s where we are.",Pam
1675,"For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley… although, I get it.",Pam
1676,"There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I’ll get there. And if I don’t get there, I don’t get there.",Pam
1677,Julie laughs at everything.,Pam
1678,"It’s my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?… It rocked. It rocked my ass off.",Pam
1679,"I’m not saying she’s in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.",Pam
1680,"So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. This photo was taken this morning. It’s Cece. She’s never gonna do anything wrong.",Pam
1681,"I feel horrible for blowing Jim’s prank. I don’t know if you can tell, but he’s mildly upset. And Dwight hasn’t been messed with in a while, so he’s become a monster. I need to make this right.",Pam
1682,"The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that’s fair.",Pam
1683,There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That’s the main way. But this could work.,Pam
1684,"Hey Michael, um… about three months ago, I was talking to…",Pam

1693,"I’m the office administrator now, which means I’m basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head… I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.",Pam
1694,"I’ve been working forever on Jim’s present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He’ll take a memory or a private joke, and he’ll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes ‘bear man’. Wreaks havoc on the office.
